High-level items on the "to do" list.
-------------------------------------

 0. Instruct Apache to redirect /kn to pubsub.cgi .
    (Now INSTALL has instructions for how to do this; use
    pubsub_test.cgi?url=http://localhost/kn to test it; however, various
    things, including pubsub.cgi and pubsub_test.cgi, still expect
    other things to live near pubsub.cgi in URL-space.  We'll correct
    this soon...)
 1. Create a mod_pubsub self-contained Apache module that
    subsumes the best practices of pubsub.cgi and pubsub.py .
 2. Create a php_pubsub client.
 3. Revamp RSS Support because kn_sense/rss is an awful hack.
    Use Jeff Barr's wonderful http://www.syndic8.com/ tools.
 4. Create a PubSub::Server.Pm and make pubsub.cgi a thin
    wrapper around it.  (Note: we have already merged "KNMS"
    into Client.pm .)  Part of this project may include making
    Tunnel.pm event-driven.
 5. Unify the Perl PubSub client and server and
    submit the PubSub perl package to CPAN.
 6. Import (and extend) Phil Harris' python pubsub client from
    http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/
 7. Clean up python_pubsub so it doesn't need to ship with
    all those other .py files.  (Ka-Ping Yee?  We wish...)
 8. Get push_manager working and clean up its directory.
 9. pubsub.cgi should be less lazy about detecting closed
    sessions.  Bring active presence detection to mod_pubsub.
10. While we're at it, clean up any broken and/or ugly kn_apps.
11. pubsub.js -- fix to deal with long lived IE6 sessions.
12. Build an Apache log sensor and use that to create a
    "webmaster's dashboard" application.
13. Get "Pocket NOC" application that monitors machines
    working to create a "sysadmin's dashboard" application.
14. Write a Jabber gateway using mod_pubsub.
15. Write an (all-DHTML) IM client application using mod_pubsub.
16. Get Pushlets working with mod_pubsub.
17. Import applications from http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/
18. Improve and extend pubsub_test.cgi .
19. Build performance testing tools.
20. Import Greg Burd's ruby pubsub client from
    http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/
    (Didn't think we were going to forget that one, did you? :)
21. Get working Fred Sanchez's chess application from
    http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/
22. Start a Wiki for this project.
    (?As part of the REST Wiki?  Talk with Mark Baker & Jeff Bone...)
23. In the kn_apps directory, unify kn_lib and jscomponents.
