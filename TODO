 0. Instruct Apache to redirect /kn to pubsub.cgi .
    (Now INSTALL has instructions for how to do this; use
    pubsub_test.cgi?url=http://localhost/kn to test it; however, various
    things, including pubsub.cgi and pubsub_test.cgi, still expect
    other things to live near pubsub.cgi in URL-space.  We'll correct
    this soon...)

 1. Create a mod_pubsub self-contained Apache module that
    subsumes the best practices of pubsub.cgi and pubsub.py .

 2. After inspecting Phil Harris' python pubsub client from
    http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/
    it looks like we can really use a decent reference python pubsub client.

    (Update 2/2003: We have an initial Python PubSub Client in
    python_pubsub/pubsublib.py that has publish, subscribe, and
    unsubscribe.  This still needs several things added; see the
    source code for FIXME's and TODO's.)

 3. Create a PubSub::Server.Pm and make pubsub.cgi a thin
    wrapper around it.  (Note: we have already merged "KNMS"
    into Client.pm .)  Part of this project may include making
    Tunnel.pm event-driven.

 4. Unify the Perl PubSub client and server and
    submit the PubSub perl package to CPAN.

 5. Create a php_pubsub client.

 6. Revamp RSS Support because kn_sense/rss is an awful hack.
    Use Jeff Barr's wonderful http://www.syndic8.com/ tools.
    [Note: cxx_pubsub contains an RSS-sensing tool for Windows.]

 7. Clean up python_pubsub so it doesn't need to ship with
    all those other .py files.  (Ka-Ping Yee?  We wish...)

 8. Get push_manager working and clean up its directory.

 9. pubsub.cgi should be less lazy about detecting closed
    sessions.  Bring active presence detection to mod_pubsub.
    Perhaps do this using a cleanup.py program.

10. While we're at it, clean up any broken and/or ugly kn_apps.
    "replay" is a particularly useful kn_app that is broken.

11. pubsub.js -- fix to deal with long lived IE6 sessions.

12. Build an Apache log sensor and use that to create a
    "webmaster's dashboard" application.

13. Get "Pocket NOC" application that monitors machines
    working to create a "sysadmin's dashboard" application.

14. Write a Jabber gateway using mod_pubsub.

15. Write an (all-DHTML) IM client application using mod_pubsub.

16. Get Pushlets working with mod_pubsub.

17. Import applications from http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/

18. Improve and extend pubsub_test.cgi .

19. Build performance testing tools.

20. Import Greg Burd's ruby pubsub client from
    http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/
    (Didn't think we were going to forget that one, did you? :)

21. Get working Fred Sanchez's chess application from
    http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/

22. Start a Wiki for this project.
    (?As part of the REST Wiki?  Talk with Mark Baker & Jeff Bone...)
