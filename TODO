 1. Create a mod_pubsub self-contained Apache module that
    subsumes the best practices of pubsub.cgi and pubsub.py .

 2. Instruct Apache to redirect /kn to pubsub.cgi .
    (Now INSTALL has instructions for how to do this; use
    pubsub_test.cgi?url=http://localhost/kn to test it; however, various
    things, including pubsub.cgi and pubsub_test.cgi, still expect
    other things to live near pubsub.cgi in URL-space.  We'll correct
    this soon...)

 3. We have an initial Python PubSub Client in python_pubsub/pubsublib.py
    that has publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe.  This still needs a
    test suite and several other things; see python_pubsub/TODO for
    next things on the list.

 4. pubsub.cgi and pubsub.py should be less lazy about detecting
    closed sessions.  Bring active presence detection to mod_pubsub.
    Perhaps do this by writing an external cleanup.py program.

5A. Create an installer for cxx_pubsub/LibKN so Windows developers have
    a pre-compiled build they can use easily.

5B. Compile pubsub.py into a pubsub.exe that Windows folks can run easily.
    Then we'll have a "Windows PubSub Server".  (Alternatively, figure out
    how to use Jython to compile pubsub.py and pubsublib.py into Java
    bytecodes so we can run them within a JVM.)

5C. Build c_pubsub/libkn on cygwin.

 6. Create a java_pubsub client library.  Greg suggests creating a clean
    Java API usable in any type of Java client (app server based or not)
    and then layer a JMS interface on top of that.  This makes it easier to
    develop and easier to maintain over time while covering all the bases.

 7. pubsub.js -- fix it to deal with long lived IE6 sessions.

 8. Make Tunnel.pm event-driven.
    Unify the Perl PubSub client and server and
    submit the PubSub perl package to CPAN.

 9. Revamp RSS Support because kn_sense/rss is an awful hack.
    Use Jeff Barr's wonderful http://www.syndic8.com/ tools.
    (Update 3/2003: cxx_pubsub contains a Windows RSS-sensing tool.)

10. While we're at it, clean up any broken and/or ugly kn_apps.
    "replay" is a particularly useful kn_app that is broken.

11. Get push_manager working and clean up its directory.

12. Build an Apache log sensor and use that to create a
    "webmaster's dashboard" application.

13. Get "Pocket NOC" application that monitors machines
    working to create a "sysadmin's dashboard" application.
    (Update 3/2003: kn_apps/sitewatch is a first-pass at this.
    It needs to be improved significantly, perhaps using
    kn_sense/apache_logfile.sh .)

14. Write a Jabber gateway using mod_pubsub.  And/or
    write an (all-DHTML) IM client application using mod_pubsub.

15. Get Pushlets working with mod_pubsub.

16. Get chess application from http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/ working.

17. Start a Wiki for this project.
    (?As part of the REST Wiki?
    http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/ )

18. doxygen comments.  Heck, more documentation all around!
    Flesh out mod_pubsub/kn_docs/design_notes/...
