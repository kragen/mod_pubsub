 1. Fix kn_apps/kn_lib/cookie_auth.js so that it properly escapes userids.

 2. Modify the Perl PubSub Server and the Python PubSub Server to not
    send so many flush spaces when writing simple response format.
    This will make our simple wire format less chatty.

 3. We have an initial Python PubSub Client in python_pubsub/pubsublib.py
    that has publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe.  This still needs a
    test suite and several other improvements:
    A. use ZODB for persistence layer of pubsub.py
    B. "depth:" header in pubsub.py; modify topic & tree kn_apps to use it
    C. bridge.py bridging application
    D. auth in pubsub.py
    E. ulimit in pubsub.py
    F. off-host routes in pubsub.py
    G. kn_content_transform in pubsub.py
    H. pubsub.py watchdog
    I. pubsub.py stats
    J. kn_apps/sitewatch2 : watch stats and notify if down
       i. browser-based
       ii. watches stats
       iii. on two routers
       iv. emails if down
       v. depends on A, B, C, D, G, H, and I
    K. CGI support in pubsub.py
    L. SSL support

 4. cgi-bin/PubSub/ModPubSub.pm and cgi-bin/pubsub_test.cgi still expect
    other things to live near cgi-bin/PubSub/ModPubSub.pm in URL-space.
    Fix this.

 5. Create an installer for cxx_pubsub/LibKN so Windows developers have
    a pre-compiled build they can use easily.

 6. Compile pubsub.py into a pubsub.exe that Windows folks can run easily.
    Then we'll have a "Windows PubSub Server".  (Alternatively, figure out
    how to use Jython to compile pubsub.py and pubsublib.py into Java
    bytecodes so we can run them within a JVM.)

 7. Build c_pubsub/libkn on cygwin.

 8. Make Tunnel.pm event-driven.
    Also, PubSub/ModPubSub.pm should be less lazy about detecting
    closed sessions.  Bring active presence detection to it.
    Unify the Perl PubSub Server and Client libraries, and
    submit the PubSub perl package to CPAN.

 9. Clean up any broken and/or ugly kn_apps.

10. Build an Apache log sensor and use that to create a
    "webmaster's dashboard" application.

11. Write a Jabber gateway using mod_pubsub.
    And/or write an (all-DHTML) IM client application using mod_pubsub.

12. Get Pushlets working with mod_pubsub.

13. Get "Pocket NOC" application that monitors machines
    working to create a "sysadmin's dashboard" application.
    (Update 3/2003: kn_apps/sitewatch is a first-pass at this.
    It needs to be improved significantly, perhaps using
    kn_sense/apache_logfile.sh .)

14. Make a REST Wiki page for mod_pubsub...
    http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/

15. doxygen comments.  Heck, more documentation all around!
    Flesh out mod_pubsub/kn_docs/design_notes/...

16. Revamp RSS Support because kn_sense/rss is an awful hack.
    Use Jeff Barr's wonderful http://www.syndic8.com/ tools.
    (Update 3/2003: cxx_pubsub contains a Windows RSS-sensing tool.)

17. An application that uses Amazon Web Services.

18. Get chess application from http://cvs.developer.knownow.com/ working.

19. An application that uses httptop from O'Reilly's _Linux Hacks_ book.

20. Get push_manager working and clean up its directory.

21. do_method=replay doesn't work.  It should.  Make it so.
