Build process
-------------

1. Add a release on Sourceforge.  At

   http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=66293

   click [Add Release] on the mod-pubsub line.

2. Create the release by adding the new release name, for example

   0.95

   Click "Create this release"

3. On the Summary page

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-pubsub/

   Click "Download" for the latest release, which will give you
   the latest release's download URL, for example

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66293&release_id=161313

4. Edit mod_pubsub/kn_docs/faq.html to include the URL from step 3
   in all the links that say "download".  For example,

   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66293&release_id=161313" onclick="window.open(this.href,this.target);return false" target="_blank">
   <button>Download v0.95 now</button></a>

   and

   <p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66293&release_id=1
61313" target="_blank">Download</a>

   View this file in a Web browser to make sure the HTML is well-formed.

5. Check in the new faq.html

   pubsub-cvs commit

6. Tag everything at the top level with the current date.

   pubsub-cvs tag -R mod-pubsub-2003-05-23

7. Export mod_pubsub with the tag created in step 6.

   pubsub-cvs export -r mod-pubsub-2003-05-23 mod_pubsub

8. Run "cd mod_pubsub; make"

   which creates pubsub.js in the right place but fails to
   create the kn_events directory and exits with an

   [ x"" != x ]  # Define HTTPD_USER as the user that runs your web server, e.g. make HTTPD_USER=httpd (or nobody, or www-data)
   make: *** [kn_events] Error 1

   error.  (Downloaders will make their own kn_events directory.)

9. Create the tarball.  For example,

   cd ..; tar czvf mod_pubsub_2003-05-23.tar.gz mod_pubsub

10. Upload the tarball.  For example,

   ftp upload.sf.net
   user anonymous
   cd incoming
   put mod_pubsub_2003-05-23.tar.gz
   quit

11. In the Web browser that says "Project mod-pubsub: Admin: FRS: Releases"
   go through steps 1 and 2 to insert notes and add the file.

   In step 3, choose architecture "Platform Independent" and
   type "Source .gz"

12. Copy the new FAQ over to Sourceforge.

   rsync -va faq.html ifindkarma@shell.sf.net:/home/groups/m/mo/mod-pubsub/htdocs/index.html

13. Add news on Sourceforge Summary page

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-pubsub/

   with a title like "mod_pubsub release 0.96 is available" and text like

<blockquote> 

Download v0.96 of mod_pubsub at: 

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66293&release_id=164088 

We put together this tarball to include several 
recent patches to the PubSub Servers and 
documentation. This release includes: 

1. Joyce's fix to kn_expires in pubsub.py so it is self-cleaning. 
2. Jos's FlashTunnel class addition to pubsub.py so it 
supports kn_response_format=flash . 
3. Robert's fix to the Java client library. 
4. Simplified top-level index.html, moving the old top-level 
index.html to the top-level inventory.html . 
5. Links to the mod_pubsub weblog and the blogchatter 
application from kn_docs/faq.html . 

</blockquote>

14. Send an email to mod-pubsub-developer@lists.sourceforge.net
   telling them about the newly released version.
