 1. Add a release on Sourceforge.  At

    http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=66293

    click [Add Release] on the mod-pubsub line.

 2. Create the release by adding the new release name, for example

    0.992

    Click "Create this release"

 3. Tag everything at the top level with the current date.

    pubsub-cvs tag -R mod-pubsub-2003-08-18

 4. Export mod_pubsub with the tag created in step 6.

    pubsub-cvs export -r mod-pubsub-2003-08-18 mod_pubsub

 5. Run "cd mod_pubsub; make"

    which creates pubsub.js and kn_events in the right place
    and builds js_pubsub (and its documentation) properly.

 6. Create the tarball.  For example,

    cd ..; tar czvf mod_pubsub_2003-08-18.tar.gz mod_pubsub

 7. Upload the tarball.  For example,

    ftp upload.sf.net
    user anonymous
    cd incoming
    put mod_pubsub_2003-07-21.tar.gz
    quit

 8. In the Web browser that says "Project mod-pubsub: Admin: FRS: Releases"
    go through steps 1 and 2 to insert notes and add the file.

    In step 3, choose architecture "Platform Independent" and
    type "Source .gz"

 9. Add news on Sourceforge Summary page

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-pubsub/

    with a title like "mod_pubsub release 0.992 is available" and text like

<blockquote> 

We put together this tarball to include several 
recent patches to parts of the distribution, and
add some prototype apps, including

1. Joyce's fix to the top-level index.html and
her fixes to kn_docs/faq.html .

2. Patches and additions to cxx_pubsub/LibKN/ .

3. Jeff's perftest framework, added to
java_pubsub/apps/perftest_framework/ .
Note this needs porting to Mike and Robert's
Java pubsub client library.

4. Prototype of an AIM bridge, added to
java_pubsub/apps/maim/ .
Note this needs porting to Mike and Robert's
Java pubsub client library.
