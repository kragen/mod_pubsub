$Id: build_process.txt,v 1.5 2003/10/23 21:57:11 ifindkarma Exp $

 1. Add a release on Sourceforge.  At

    http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=66293

    click [Add Release] on the mod-pubsub line.

 2. Create the release by adding the new release name, for example

    0.993

    Click "Create this release"

 3. Tag everything at the top level with the current date.

    pubsub-cvs tag -R mod-pubsub-2003-10-23

 4. Export mod_pubsub with the tag created in step 3.

    pubsub-cvs export -r mod-pubsub-2003-10-23 mod_pubsub

 5. Run "cd mod_pubsub; make"

    which creates pubsub.js and kn_events in the right place
    and builds js_pubsub (and its documentation) properly.

 6. Create the tarball.  For example,

    cd ..; tar czvf mod_pubsub_2003-10-23.tar.gz mod_pubsub

 7. Upload the tarball(s).  For example,

    ftp upload.sf.net
    user anonymous
    cd incoming
    put mod_pubsub_2003-10-23.tar.gz
    put win32_libkndesktopinstall_2003-10-23.zip
    quit

 8. In the Web browser that says "Project mod-pubsub: Admin: FRS: Releases"
    go through steps 1 and 2 to insert notes and add the file.  If adding
    two files, add the zipfile first and the tarball second.

    In step 3, for the tarball choose architecture "Platform Independent"
    and type "Source .gz", and for the zipfile choose architecture "i386"
    and type ".zip".

 9. Add news on Sourceforge Summary page

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-pubsub/

    with a title like "mod_pubsub release 0.993 is available" and text like

<blockquote> 

We put together this tarball to include several 
recent patches to parts of the distribution, and
add a useful app for webdevs, including:

A. Joyce's addition of topicsubtool.php found in
the directory mod_pubsub/webdev_toolkit .

B. A patch to the ServerSaver to hammer the CPU
less in mod_pubsub/python_pubsub/pubsub.py .

C. Patches to mod_pubsub/python_pubsub/apps/repeater.py
to make it more useful.

Download v0.993 of mod_pubsub at: 

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66293&release_id=192963

</blockquote>

10. Send an email to mod-pubsub-developer@lists.sourceforge.net
    telling them about the newly released version.
