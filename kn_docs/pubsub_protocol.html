<h1>PubSub Protocol</h1>

<p>This document outlines the interface provided by mod_pubsub.  Section
<a href="#1">1</a> explains the layout and contents of a typical event.
Section <a href="#2">2</a> documents the HTTP interface, and section
<a href="#3">3</a> documents the JavaScript callback interface.</p>

<h2><a name="1" id="1">1. Events</a></h2>

<p>Each event processed by mod_pubsub contains a set of elements, with a
name and a value for each element. The element names and values are
strings of Unicode or UCS characters. Some elements with special meaning
are described in section <a href="#2.2">2.2</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that elements follow the naming and meaning of HTTP
headers when appropriate, using <code>kn_payload</code> for message
bodies. For example, a property named "<code>content-type</code>" whose
value is "<samp>text/plain</samp>" would indicate to a receiver that the
<code>kn_payload</code> property is a text string.</p>

<p>However, since element names are case-sensitive, we recommend using
lowercase equivalents of the analogous HTTP header names.</p>

<p>A sample event might include the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>An element named "<samp>element1</samp>" with the value
"<samp>value1</samp>"</li>
<li>An element named "<samp>kn_payload</samp>" with the value
"<samp>This is the kn_payload.<em class="highlight">LF</em>This is
Greek: <em
class="highlight">&#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#949;</em></samp>"</li>
<li>An element named "<samp>element2</samp>" with the value "<samp><em
class="highlight">SP</em>value2<em class="highlight">LF</em>Japanese:
<em
class="highlight">&#12481;&#12515;&#12483;&#12488;</em></samp>"</li>
<li>An element named "<samp>element<em class="highlight">LF</em>three
is<em class="highlight">NUL</em>long</samp>" with the value
"<samp>1</samp>"</li>
<li>An element named "<samp>kn_id</samp>" with the value
"<samp>979273892_861_2249</samp>"</li>
</ul>

<p>Some parts of the above example include <em
class="highlight">highlighted</em> characters with special
meanings:</p>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><samp>NUL</samp></dt>

<dd>A null character (character 0, <code>U+0000</code>)</dd>

<dt><samp>LF</samp></dt>

<dd>The linefeed character (character 10,
<code>U+000A</code>)</dd>

<dt><samp>SP</samp></dt>

<dd>The literal space character (character 32,
<code>U+0020</code>)</dd>

<dt><samp>&#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#949;</samp></dt>

<dd>The Greek word <em>kosme</em> (a five-character string,
<code>U+03BA,U+1F79,U+03C3,U+03BC,U+03B5</code>)</dd>

<dt><samp>&#12481;&#12515;&#12483;&#12488;</samp></dt>

<dd>The Japanese word <em>tyatto</em> (a four-character string,
<code>U+30C1,U+30E3,U+30C3,U+30C8</code>)</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>Elements may appear in any order, and each element must have a unique
name. The order of elements is not preserved. Elements and values may
include any UCS or Unicode character (including reserved characters
and characters not yet allocated) and may be of any length.</p>

<h2><a name="2" id="2">2. HTTP Interface</a></h2>

<p>mod_pubsub implements the HTTP <code>GET</code> and
<code>POST</code> methods. The <code>POST</code> method is
preferred for route and notification requests, as it avoids
overlong URLs, and is a better semantic match than <code>GET</code>
for these nonidempotent operations. The <code>GET</code> method is
preferred for the remaining request types, as their results are
intended to be cached for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Parameters are sent in the same formats used for HTML fill-out form
submissions. For HTTP POST requests, parameters are sent as POST data
in <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format. For HTTP GET
requests, parameters are sent as URL query strings in
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format. Parameters and
values use the UTF-8 character set encoding. Path information,
the part of the URL path following the server URL,
can be used to specify a default topic for
<code>route</code> and <code>notify</code> requests, but does not count
as a parameter.</p>

<p>The parameters described in section <a href="#2.1">2.1</a> select
operations and options; those described in section
<a href="#2.2">2.2</a> are available as event elements, and are propagated
along routes (except as otherwise noted.) Parameters not listed here are
generally available for use as application-specific event elements, with
the exception of parameter names starting with "<samp>kn_</samp>", which
are reserved for future use by mod_pubsub. The parameters described in
section <a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a> are used in status events, which are
generated to indicate the success or failure of a request.</p>

<h3><a name="2.1" id="2.1">2.1 Control</a></h3>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><code>do_method</code></dt>

<dd><p>Select a command:</p>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><samp>route</samp></dt>

<dd>Establish a route from <code>kn_from</code> to <code>kn_to</code>
(an empty <code>kn_to</code> is used to signal route deletion.)
Generates a status event, as described in section
<a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>. If parameters are given, but no
<code>do_method</code> is given, this is the default behavior for an
HTTP GET. If <code>kn_to</code> is not specified (or is a string
starting with <samp>javascript:</samp>,) open a persistent HTTP
connection with a stream of events from the specified source topic,
which must be a <code>kn_journal</code>.  If no <code>kn_from</code>
parameter is given, <code>kn_from</code> defaults to the path
information.</dd>

<dt><samp>notify</samp></dt>

<dd>Post an event to <code>kn_to</code>. Generates a
status event, as described in section <a
href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>. If parameters are given, but
no <code>do_method</code> parameter is given, this
is the default behavior for an HTTP POST.
If no <code>kn_to</code> parameter
is given, <code>kn_to</code> defaults to the path
information.</dd>

<dt><samp>batch</samp></dt>

<dd>Send several <code>route</code> or <code>notify</code> requests (or
some of each), one per <code>kn_batch</code> parameter.  Generates a
status event, as described in section <a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>, as do
the individual batched requests. All status events from the batched
events use the <code>kn_response_format</code> and
<code>kn_status_to</code> parameters supplied with the top-level
<code>batch</code> request.</dd>

<dt><samp>replay</samp></dt>

<dd>Begin the replay of all old events stored on the
<code>kn_from</code> topic, which should normally be a
<code>kn_journal</code> topic; each event is reposted to the topic from
which it was routed to the <code>kn_from</code> topic.  Timing intervals
between event postings are preserved, but each event is given a new
<code>kn_id</code> so duplicate-squashing won't kill it.  The first
replayed event is posted immediately.  If <code>kn_from</code> is not
specified, it defaults to the path information.  <samp>replay</samp>
also takes parameters <code>user</code> and <code>password</code>, which
specify a username and password to be used for authentication when
reposting the events (note: this is a major security hole), and a
floating-point parameter <code>warp</code>; if <code>warp</code> is
specified, the intervals between events are divided by
<code>warp</code>.  So, for example, if <code>warp</code> is
<samp>2.5</samp>, the events will play back 2.5 times as fast as they
were originally posted.  <code>replay</code> <a href="#2.2.3">generates
a status event</a>.</dd>

<dt><samp>whoami</samp></dt>

<dd>Return JavaScript to set session-specific <code>window</code>
string properties (all are optional, and UTF-8 encoded): 

<div class="dl">

JavaScript Library Reference</a> for further details.</dd>

<dt><samp>libform</samp></dt>

<dd>Return the <code>kn:</code> scheme fill-out form handler
(includes results of <code>lib</code>.) 

<blockquote>
<p>The form library must be included at the very beginning
of your DHTML application:</p>

<pre>

    &lt;script src="/kn?do_method=libform"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>To publish events to a topic, use an HTML
<code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element with
<code>action="kn:/<var>topic</var>"</code> and
<code>method="POST"</code>. Your form fields will be sent as an
event each time the form is submitted.</p>

<p>To subscribe to a topic, use an HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>
element with <code>action="kn:/<var>topic</var>"</code> and
<code>method="GET"</code>. Matching form fields will be filled in
and your <code>onsubmit</code> handler (if you have one) will be
invoked for each received event.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt><samp>lib2form</samp></dt>

<dd>Return the <code>kn:</code> scheme two-way fill-out form handler
(includes results of <code>lib</code>.) 

<blockquote>

</dd>

<dt><samp>blank</samp></dt>

<dd>Return an empty HTML document with a JavaScript callback, as
described in section <a href="#3">3</a>. Essential for enforcing
the JavaScript 'same-domain' security policy (this is useful because
JavaScript access to <samp>about:blank</samp> is sometimes
restricted.)</dd>

<dt><samp>help</samp></dt>

<dt><code>kn_response_format</code></dt>

<dd><p>
Select a format for events returned by <code>route</code>,

as described in section <a href="#3">3</a>.  This is the
default.</p></dd>

<dt><samp>simple</samp></dt>

<dd>
<p>Delivers events in a simple format resembling RFC-822, possibly
with whitespace padding before and after encoded
events. The sample event from
section <a href="#1">1</a> would be formatted as follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
179
element1: value1
element2: =20value2=0AJapanese: &#12481;&#12515;&#12483;&#12488;
element=0Athree=20is=20=00long: 1
kn_id: 979273892_861_2249

This is the kn_payload.
This is Greek: &#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#949;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Each encoded event is preceded be a decimal byte count (<em>not</em> a
character count) for the encoded form
and a linefeed (character 10, <code>U+000A</code>),
and followed by a linefeed. These are not part of the
encoded event, and are not included in the byte count.
When encoded, the sample event includes 176 bytes.</p>

<p>Encoded events include a sequence of zero or more elements followed
by a linefeed and the <code>kn_payload</code> value. Each element in an
encoded event consists of an element name, a colon, a single space, an
element value, and a linefeed. The element names and the element values
may both include bytes which are encoded in MIME Quoted-Printable style
(i.e. <code>=</code><var>XX</var>, where <var>XX</var> is the uppercase
hexadecimal representation of the quoted byte value.) A server will
always escape the following bytes: colon (U+003A), the equals sign
(U+003D), and leading and trailing spaces (U+0020) in element names and
values. Other bytes may be escaped, as in the above example (where all
control characters are escaped.) UTF-8 sequences of two or more bytes
may have none, some or all bytes escaped.</p>

<p>The list of elements never includes <code>kn_payload</code>.
The <code>kn_payload</code> value is not encoded
in MIME Quoted-Printable style.</p>

<p>Element names, element values and the <code>kn_payload</code> value
are UTF-8 encoded (so <samp>&#12481;&#12515;&#12483;&#12488;</samp> in
the above example is encoded [and counted] as the 12 bytes <samp>0xE3,
0x83, 0x81, 0xE3, 0x83, 0xA3, 0xE3, 0x83, 0x83, 0xE3, 0x83,
0x88</samp>; <samp>&#954;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#949;</samp> is
encoded [and counted] as the 11 bytes <samp>0xCE, 0xBA, 0xE1, 0xBD,
0xB9, 0xCF, 0x83, 0xCE, 0xBC, 0xCE, 0xB5</samp>.)</p>

<h3><a name="2.2" id="2.2">2.2. Event Elements</a></h3>

<p>As described in section <a href="#1">1</a>, each event contains a
set of elements, which are sent as parameters of the HTTP request.</p>

<p>Certain event elements have special meaning. Those described in
section <a href="#2.2.1">2.2.1</a> apply to all events. Those
described in section <a href="#2.2.2">2.2.2</a> apply only to routes,
and those in section <a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a> apply only to status
events.</p>

<h4><a name="2.2.1" id="2.2.1">2.2.1. All Events</a></h4>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><code>content-type</code></dt>

<dd>MIME-style content type for the data in <code>kn_payload</code>,
e.g.  <samp>text/plain</samp>, <samp>image/gif</samp>,
<samp>text/html</samp>, <samp>application/octet-stream</samp> or
<samp>text/xml</samp>. In general, all <samp>text/*</samp> media types
should undergo character set and encoding conversion to UCS or Unicode
(encoded as UTF-8) before being sent in a request to mod_pubsub.
The use of <code>content-type</code> qualifiers
(e.g. <samp>charset=utf-8</samp>) is discouraged.  Since UCS or Unicode
(encoded as UTF-8) is already the implied character set and encoding for
event element names and values, a <samp>charset</samp> qualifier is
unnecessary.</dd>

<dt><code>deleted</code></dt>

<dd>Flag to mark deleted events. If the value of the
<code>deleted</code> element is the string <samp>true</samp>, an
application receiving it should process the event as a notification of
deletion. Any other value for this element should be ignored. It is
recommended that the <code>kn_payload</code> of a deleted event be
empty, and that a deleted event have a <code>kn_expires</code> element
with the value <samp>+3600</samp>.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_payload</code></dt>

<dd>Event payload, analogous to a message body. If
<code>kn_payload</code> is not present, mod_pubsub will insert this
element with the empty string as the value.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_id</code></dt>

<dd>Event ID (default: a pseudorandom string, e.g.
<samp>979273892_861_2249</samp>.) An event on a non-journal topic may be
updated by posting again to the same topic using the same
<code>kn_id</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_route_checkpoint</code></dt>

<dd>Every time a new or updated event is posted to a
particular topic, it is assigned a
new <code>kn_route_checkpoint</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_time_t</code></dt>

<dd>Event timestamp expressed as seconds since Thu Jan 1 00:00:00
1970 UTC (default: event creation time, e.g. <samp>979273892</samp>
for an event created at Fri Jan 12 04:31:32 2001 UTC)</dd>

<dt><code>kn_expires</code></dt>

<dd>Event or route expiration time expressed either in the same format as
<code>kn_time_t</code> or as a positive offset in seconds from the time of
the event's arrival, e.g. <samp>+15</samp> to expire 15 seconds
after arrival. When a route with no <code>kn_to</code> expires,
the persistent connection is closed and the journal topic becomes
stale.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_route_location</code></dt>

<dd>URI of the route this event was forwarded along most recently,
e.g.
<samp>http://foo/mod_pubsub/cgi-bin/pubsub.cgi/what/chat/kn_routes/964832125_29689_47</samp>,
which may be overridden by the <code>kn_uri</code> route parameter
for routed events or provided by the <code>kn_status_from</code>
parameter for status events</dd>

<dt><code>kn_route_id</code></dt>

<dd>The <code>kn_id</code> of the route this event was most

request the immediate forwarding of the most recent few events as if
they had just been delivered; this is called "initial route
population".  <code>do_max_age</code> and <code>do_max_n</code> are
different ways of specifying how many events to forward;
<samp>do_max_age=<var>nseconds</var></samp> requests that events
younger than <var>nseconds</var> seconds be forwarded, while
<samp>do_max_n=<var>n</var></samp> requests that the youngest
<var>n</var> events be forwarded.  For the purpose of initial route
population, an event's age is the amount of time since it was posted
to the topic.  At present, <code>do_max_n</code> is ignored if
<code>do_max_age</code> is specified.</dd>

-->

<dt><code>do_max_age</code></dt>

<dd>If this parameter is present, all previously posted events
in the source topic which have not expired will be forwarded along
the route, provided they were posted within the time period defined
by the value of this parameter. The value of this parameter is
either an age in seconds (e.g. <samp>30</samp> for events posted
within the previous 30 seconds) or <samp>infinity</samp> (for all
previously posted events.) The previously posted events will be
forwarded along the route before the status event indicating
route success is sent

sent first.)</dd>

<dt><code>do_since_checkpoint</code></dt>

<dd>If this parameter is present, its value is
a <code>kn_route_checkpoint</code> corresponding to a previous post to the

</dl>
</div>

<h4><a name="2.2.3" id="2.2.3">2.2.3. Status Events</a></h4>

<p>mod_pubsub generates status events to indicate
the success or failure of <code>route</code>, <code>notify</code> and
<code>batch</code> requests, as well as requests with unknown
<code>do_method</code>s.  Each such request, whether in a batch or by
itself on an HTTP connection, generates a status event; so, for
example, a <code>batch</code> containing a <code>route</code> and two
<code>notify</code>s will generate a status event for the batch, a
status event for the route, and two more status events for the
<code>notify</code>s.</p>

<p>If <code>kn_status_to</code> is not specified, the status events
are sent back in the body of the HTTP response, and the HTTP
response's status line is taken from the <code>status</code> field of
the first status event; <code>kn_response_format</code> determines how
they are represented.  If <code>kn_status_to</code> is specified,
however, the HTTP response uses <samp>204 No Content</samp> as the
HTTP status code and reason phrase, and as per RFC 2616, there is no
response body; instead, the events are forwarded to the topic whose
URL is specified as the value of <code>kn_status_to</code>.</p>

<p>This hack is to coddle browsers; if a browser submits a form in a
frame, even a hidden frame, and get back a non-204 response, it adds
an entry to the browser history --- effectively breaking the Back
button.  <code>kn_status_to</code> allows success and failure status
to be sent to the browser via the tunnel frame.</p>

<p>Status events include at least these two elements:</p>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><code>status</code></dt>

<dd>A status code and brief description in HTTP format, e.g. a
three-digit code followed by a descriptive string. 1<var>xx</var>,
2<var>xx</var> and 3<var>xx</var> codes generally indicate success,
while 4<var>xx</var> and 5<var>xx</var> generally indicate errors.  If
this is the first event being sent back over the requesting connection
(which happens when <code>kn_status_to</code> was not set and the
request is not part of a batch), this will also be sent as the HTTP
status code and reason phrase.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_payload</code></dt>

<dd>Ideally, a detailed and human-readable description of what
happened in plain text format. In practice, it is often empty.</dd>

<h2><a name="3" id="3">3. JavaScript Interface</a></h2>

<p>mod_pubsub generates HTML with JavaScript callbacks for event
delivery and for dynamic document handling. Section <a
href="#3.1">3.1</a> describes the JavaScript format used for event
delivery, and section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a> lists the supported
callbacks. It is recommended that JavaScript applications not use these
callbacks directly. Instead, they should use the interface described in
the <a href="javascript_reference.html">PubSub JavaScript Library
Reference</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.1" id="3.1">3.1. Event Format</a></h3>

<p>mod_pubsub packages events in JavaScript <var>event</var> objects
when using the <samp>js</samp> <code>kn_response_format</code> (see
section <a href="#2.1">2.1</a>.)  Each <var>event</var> object includes
an array of <code>&lt;INPUT&gt;</code>-style <code>elements</code> with
<code>name</code> and <code>value</code> strings corresponding to UTF-16
encoded event element names and values. If a particular element name or
value has not already been decoded from UTF-8 into UTF-16 by mod_pubsub,
the letter <code>U</code> will be appended to the property name, making
it <code>nameU</code> or <code>valueU</code>. The UTF-8 encoded string
must include JavaScript UTF-16 characters with values corresponding to
the bytes in the UTF-8 sequence; that is, it must be encoded as UTF-8
and then represented using one JavaScript character per UTF-8 byte.
mod_pubsub might choose to provide only a UTF-8 version of a particular
string, it might choose to provide only a UTF-16 version, or it might
choose to provide both UTF-8 and UTF-16 versions.  The sample event
described in section <a href="#1">1</a> would be structured as
follows:</p>

<pre>
<var>event</var> =
{ 
    elements: 
    [ 
        { 
            nameU: "element1", 
            value: "value1" 
        }, 
        { 
            name: "kn_payload", 
            valueU: "This is the kn_payload.\nThis is Greek: " +
                "\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xce\xb5" 
        }, 
        { 
            nameU: "element2", 
            valueU: " value2\nJapanese: " +
                "\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x83\x83\xe3\x83\x88" 
        }, 
        { 
            name: "element\nthree is\0long", 
            value: "1" 
        }, 
        { 
            name: "kn_id", 
            nameU: "kn_id", 
            value: "979273892_861_2249" 
            valueU: "979273892_861_2249" 
        }
    ] 
} 
</pre>

<p>Typical usage of an <var>event</var>:</p>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><var>event</var><code>.elements.length</code></dt>

<dd>number of element name-value pairs (see section <a
href="#2">2</a>) in an <var>event</var> (<samp>5</samp>, in this
example)</dd>

<dt><var>event</var><code>.elements[0].nameU</code></dt>

<dd>UTF-8 encoded name of the first element in an <var>event</var>
(<samp>"element1"</samp>, in this example)</dd>

<dt><var>event</var><code>.elements[1].name</code></dt>

<dd>UTF-16 encoded name of the second element in an <var>event</var>
(<samp>"kn_payload"</samp>, in this example)</dd>

<dt><var>event</var><code>.elements[2].valueU</code></dt>

<dd>UTF-8 encoded value associated with the third element in an
<var>event</var> (<samp>" value2\nJapanese:
\xe3\x83\x81\xe3\x83\xa3\xe3\x83\x83\xe3\x83\x88"</samp>, in this
example)</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>Note that the JavaScript event format used here differs from the
one used by the higher-level functions described in the <a
href="javascript_reference.html">PubSub JavaScript Library
Reference</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2" id="3.2">3.2. Callbacks</a></h3>

<p>mod_pubsub communicates with JavaScript-enabled web browsers through
the following callbacks:</p>

<div class="dl">
<dl>
<dt><code>parent.kn_tunnelLoadCallback(window)</code></dt>

<dd><p>Called when a tunnel connection (as produced by
<code>do_method=route</code> with no <code>kn_to</code> or
a <samp>javascript:</samp> <code>kn_to</code>)
is closed.</p></dd>

<dt><a name="sendCallback"><code>parent.kn_sendCallback(<var>event</var>,
window)</code></a></dt>

<dd><p>Called whenever an <var>event</var> is received. The format of
an <var>event</var> is described in section <a
href="#3.1">3.1</a>.</p></dd>

<dt><code>parent.kn_redrawCallback(window)</code></dt>

<dd><p>Called while <code>do_method=blank</code> is loading. Used by
the KNDocument class to render HTML pages dynamically.</p></dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>The <code>window</code> parameter passed to all three callbacks may
be used to determine which frame a callback was called in.</p>
