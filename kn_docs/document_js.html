<h1>document.js Helper Library</h1>

<p>KNDocument (the JavaScript class in document.js) is a workaround for
several JavaScript problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>insufficient DOM implementation in Netscape 4.x <i>(Netscape
doesn't allow the document to be modified after it's finished
loading.)</i></li>

<li>poor Unicode support in Netscape 4.x <i>(Netscape only recognizes
Unicode numeric character references when sent <code>content-type:
text/plain; charset=utf-8</code>.)</i></li>

<li>poor reload and redraw handling <i>(Normally, reloading or [in
Netscape 4.x] redrawing a dynamically-generated document causes it to be
reloaded from the last <strong>static</strong> location, or causes
entities to be erroneously re-interpreted.)</i></li>

<li>history-list pollution <i>(<code>document.open</code> adds an
entry to the history list.)</i></li>

<li>slow <code>document.write</code> <i>(lots of small writes bring
a browser to a crawl)</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage of KNDocument</h2>

<p>KNDocument manages a frame for you, and keeps a string with an
image of that frame's contents. You clear the image (with the
<code>open</code> method,) add strings to it (with the
<code>write</code> and <code>writeln</code> methods,) and flush it
to the managed frame when you're done (with the <code>close</code>
method.) In other words, it's a drop-in replacement for most simple
uses of the JavaScript Document object. To use it, include
<code>kn_lib/document.js</code> from the <code>kn_apps</code> directory
right after the PubSub JavaScript Libary:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;script src="/kn?do_method=lib"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    <b>&lt;script src="../kn_lib/document.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>
</pre>

<p>Here's how to create and use a KNDocument:</p>

<pre>
<i>d</i> = new KNDocument(<var>frame</var>) <i>// constructor (renames</i> frame<i>)</i>
<i>d</i>.open() <i>// clear the cached document image</i>
<i>d</i>.write(<i>string</i>) <i>// append to the cached document image</i>
<i>d</i>.writeln(<i>string</i>) <i>// same, but appends '\n' also</i>
<i>d</i>.close() <i>// replace the frame and draw the cached document image</i>

<i>// The isReady() method is analogous to IE5's readyState property;
// the window property is a reference to the managed</i> frame
if (<i>d</i>.isReady()) <i>d</i>.window.bgColor="maroon"
</pre>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>KNDocument is actually implemented using the PubSub Server's
<code>do_method=blank</code>, which contains a call to
<code>parent.kn_redrawCallback</code>. The actual document strings are
stored in the global <code>kn</code> object provided by the KnowNow
library, and are indexed by window name (KNDocument renames the
frames it manages!) When you use the <code>close</code> method,
your KNDocument's frame is replaced with the blank page, and when
the blank page calls <code>parent.kn_redrawCallback</code>, the document
string is written into the managed frame using a regular
<code>document.write</code>. Part of the KNDocument implementation
is now in pubsub_raw.js, and KNDocument and pubsub_raw.js communicate
through the <code>kn.documents</code> table.</p>
