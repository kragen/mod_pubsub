<h1>PubSub Developer Guide</h1>

<p class="subhead">How to write live web apps with mod_pubsub</p>

<h2><a id="1" name="1">1. Summary</a></h2>

<p>Using mod_pubsub with existing web tools and browsers, web pages can
now respond to incoming events from the network -- in real-time; with
plain text, HTML, XML, and/or SOAP; and without relying on Java or
ActiveX. It works with Mozilla, Netscape, and Microsoft browsers.</p>

<h2><a id="2" name="2">2. Overview</a></h2>

<p>The ability for people to exchange information is at the heart of the
World Wide Web, but this exchange has always been one-sided -- the
browser asks the server for the information. With mod_pubsub, the
browser can receive information without continually asking the web
server for the information. Instead, the server notifies the browser
when new information becomes available.</p>

<h3><a id="2.1" name="2.1">2.1. What can I do with mod_pubsub?</a></h3>

<p>By writing pages that receive messages you can make your pages
come to life. You decide what messages to receive, what messages to
send, and even what a message looks like. Your page can listen to
chat messages and display them in the browser. You can create pages
that monitor the status of remote services. Writing a stock ticker
that is fed live updates becomes trivial - if you can write HTML,
you can write this.</p>

<h3><a id="2.2" name="2.2">2.2. How do I use it?</a></h3>

<p>mod_pubsub contains a <a href="javascript_reference.html">PubSub
JavaScript Library</a>. To use it, you include this library near the
beginning of your DHTML page.  With the toolkit you can subscribe to
topics and publish messages to topics. Subscribing is like listening -
when a message occurs on a topic, your page will hear it.</p>

<p>The three main functions in the PubSub JavaScript Library are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>kn_subscribe</code></dt>

<dd>specify the topic to listen to and a JavaScript function that
is called when a message occurs on the topic.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_unsubscribe</code></dt>

<dd>specify which subscription to stop listening to.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_publish</code></dt>

<dd>specify a topic and a message. The mod_pubsub system delivers the
message to all subscribers, in their browsers, anywhere on the planet,
in real time.</dd> </dl>

<p>See section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a> for more details</p>

<h3><a id="2.3" name="2.3">2.3. What does the code look
like?</a></h3>

<p>Here is a sample of code that listens for messages on a specific
topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--

topic = "/foo/bar";
kn_subscribe(topic,onMessage);

function onMessage(event)
{
    alert(event.kn_payload);
}

// --&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>See section <a href="#3.3">3.3</a> for examples using SOAP.</p>

<h3><a id="2.4" name="2.4">2.4. What if I don't want to use a
browser?</a></h3>

<p>The mod_pubsub system is accessed via HTTP. Everything that can be
done from within a Web browser can be done with software that sends and
receives HTTP messages. See the <a href="pubsub_protocol.html">PubSub
Protocol</a> document for details.  We provide sample client libraries
that can use mod_pubsub with Perl, Python, PHP, C, Java, Ruby, and
COM/ActiveX/.NET.</p>

<h2><a id="3" name="3">3. Details</a></h2>

<p>The mod_pubsub system consists of clients and servers.</p>

<p>Clients are offered as publish-and-subscribe libraries for
many languages, including Perl, Python, PHP, JavaScript, C,
COM/ActiveX/.NET, Java, and Ruby.  The rest of this document
uses as its example client the
<a href="javascript_reference.html">JavaScript PubSub Library</a>,
which works as an extension of a standard Web browser.  Other
client libraries have similar publish-and-subscribe features.</p>

<p>This distribution includes two separate PubSub Servers:
one is a Perl Apache module (using mod_perl), and the other is
a reference standalone Python PubSub Server that uses the same
<a href="pubsub_protocol.html">PubSub Protocol</a>.  Please
refer to the <a href="../INSTALL">Installation Instructions</a>
for details on how to run these servers.</p>

<p>Sites that use mod_pubsub can publish to and subscribe to other
mod_pubsub instances, creating a constellation of servers that route
messages to all subscribers. If one were so inclined, one could host a
central site for exchanging messages and subscribing to common topics
such as RSS based news and stock feeds.</p>

<h3><a id="3.1" name="3.1">3.1. Topics and Events</a></h3>

<p>mod_pubsub creates a system of <em>topics</em>, <em>events</em> and
<em>routes</em>. Topics contain events and routes. Events are sent to a
topic and the topic will forward that event along all of its routes. A
route can point to another topic or to a generic <em>listener</em>.</p>

<p>A topic is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier - for
example: <samp>/chat/technology/xml</samp>. To avoid name
conflicts, the topic name should start with your domain name - for
example: <samp>/tempuri.org/chat/technology/xml</samp>. A topic
name may contain only roman letters
(<code>U+0041</code>-<code>U+005A</code> and
<code>U+0061</code>-<code>U+007A</code>,) digits
(<code>U+0030</code>-<code>U+0039</code>,) slashes
(<code>U+002F</code>,) underscores (<code>U+005F</code>,) dashes
(<code>U+002D</code>,) periods (<code>U+002E</code>,) and non-ASCII
characters (<code>U+0080</code>-<code>U+10FFFF</code>) however,
periods cannot appear at the beginning or end of any
slash-separated part of a topic name.</p>

<p>(To do: topic naming constraints should be updated to conform to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/">Character Model for the World
Wide Web 1.0</a>.)</p>

<h3><a id="3.1.1" name="3.1.1">3.1.1 Journals</a></h3>

<p>A <em>journal</em> in mod_pubsub is the servers representation of an
endpoint. It is implemented as a special topic identified with a trailing
'kn_journal' in its URI (i.e. /chat/technology/xml/22690909/kn_journal).
These topics are usually associated with a client application of the mod_pubsub
server. The term journal is derived from the fact that it is a collection of
events that are sent to a particular client. The main thing to be aware of in
understanding journals is that without one the server does not know that
there is a client to send events to, i.e. there are no subscribers to a topic</p>

<p>When subscribing to a topic, the various mod_pubsub client code libraries do
the work of ensuring that the server has established a queue for the topic and
connecting the client to that topic by creating a route between it and a
journal.  The journal is uniquely identified by a randomly generated string
inserted before the kn_journal string in the topic URI (as illustrated above).
This is done to ensure that after a client is restarted there will exist only
one connection between that client and the topic, which in turn guarantees
that only one copy of an event is published to the client.</p>

<p>Note that it is also possible to connect to a topic using a well-known
journal name such as /chat/technology/xml/wellknown/kn_journal, that does not
require a randomly generated string to enforce its uniqueness. To use this
method the client code can specify either a static or a random kn_id each
time it reconnects. The server determines that the same client has
reconnected and that it can continue to use the original subscription to
publish events. <em>Note that at present, if a random kn_id is used for each
client when working with this technique and a disconnect/reconnect occurs
within a relatively short timeframe (~100s) it is possible to receive multiple
copies of the same event. This is due to the fact the the server has not had
sufficient time to detect that the client is no longer connected and so assumes
that the old connection is still valid.</em></p>

<p>To summarize, the rule for using kn_id and kn_journal is simply:
<ol>
<li>You may use either a random or a static kn_journal topic and you may use a
either static or random kn_id for each client</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the various client libraries implement this rule by
default, so in general you needn't worry too much about these details.</p>


<h3><a id="3.2" name="3.2">3.2. Using the PubSub JavaScript Library</a></h3>

<p>mod_pubsub provides a set of JavaScript libraries that can be
included in DHTML pages. These files make available a set of objects and
functions that you use to subscribe, unsubscribe and send events. In
addition, these scripts have support for identifying the current
user. Getting the current user's identity requires both that the
mod_pubsub instance is hosted on a password protected site and
that the JavaScript files are generated by mod_pubsub. All this can be
done with a single <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which points to the
mod_pubsub instance:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/kn?do_method=lib"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>The location of the pubsub.cgi file needs to be adjusted to match
the location on your server.</p>

<h3><a id="3.3" name="3.3">3.3. JavaScript API Overview</a></h3>

<p>There are several functions provided by the library. See <a
href="javascript_reference.html">the JavaScript PubSub library
reference</a> for full details.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>kn_subscribe</code></dt>

<dd>begin listening</dd>

<dt><code>kn_publish</code></dt>

<dd>send a message</dd>

<dt><code>kn_unsubscribe</code></dt>

<dd>stop listening</dd>

<dt><code>kn_publishAsSoap</code></dt>

<dd>send a SOAP message</dd>
</dl>

<h4><a id="3.3.1" name="3.3.1">3.3.1 kn_subscribe</a></h4>

<p>The kn_subscribe function creates a route between a topic and
your Web page, between two topics on the server or between a topic
on the server and a different server.</p>

<h5>Syntax</h5>

<p><code>function kn_subscribe(from, to [, options [,
handler]])</code></p>

<dl>
<dt><var>from</var></dt>

<dd>the topic to listen to. For example: <samp>/what/chat</samp>.
See <a href="#3.1">section 3.1</a> for a discussion of topic
naming.</dd>

<dt><var>to</var></dt>

<dd>The destination listener. The type of the parameter determines
its meaning:

<dl>
<dt>string</dt>

<dd>A url that represents the topic that receives messages. The url
can be relative to the server, or can be absolute and point to
another server. For example, "/chat/hobbies/sailing" identifies a
topic on the same server, and
"<samp>http://www.other.com/cgi-bin/pubsub.cgi/topicname</samp>"
identifies a topic on another server.</dd>

<dt>function</dt>

<dd>name of function in the Web page that receives messages.</dd>

<dt>object</dt>

<dd>object in the Web page that receives messages via its onMessage
method.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>options</dt>

<dd>Optional. Extra options for the subscription. This is a
JavaScript object whose properties are the extra options. Valid
options are:

<dl>
<dt><code>do_max_age</code></dt>

<dd>Requests the delivery of events that have occurred in the past
and are younger than the specified max age in seconds. Also,
"<samp>infinity</samp>" can be used to specify all previous events.
If not specified, only events that occur after the subscription is
established will be delivered. For example, to receive events that
have occurred in the past five minutes, use
"<samp>300</samp>".</dd>

<dt><code>do_max_n</code></dt>

<dd>Maximum number of recent events to be delivered. These events,
and all future events, will be delivered to the specified
destination. Default is 0</dd>

<dt><code>kn_id</code></dt>

<dd>Optional. ID of the route. This can be used to change options
of an existing subscription. If a subscription is changed, events
might be re-sent based on the value of do_max_age. If a
subscription is changed, the 'from' parameter must match the
original subscription. The id should be a globally unique id. If
not specified, the server will generate a unique id.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>handler</dt>

<dd>
<p>An optional event-handler object; use it to be notified when the
subscription completes (either successfully, implying that any
archived events you requested have been delivered, or with an
error.)</p>

<p>A simple handler object might be <code>{ onError: function(e) {
alert("Error on subscription: " + e.kn_payload) } }</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Return value</h5>

<p>The route location for the subscription. See kn_unsubscribe. The
route location is a text string generated by mod_pubsub that combines
the source topic and the id of the route. For example:
"<samp>/chat/kn_routes/46165443</samp>".</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<p>The PubSub JavaScript Library will call the specified function or
object when a message occurs on the specified topic. The function will
be passed in one parameter - the event object. When using kn_subscribe
with an object, the "onMessage" method will be called by the mod_pubsub
system and will be passed one parameter - the event.</p>

<p>When the kn_subscribe function is used to establish a route between
two topics on the server, there are additional options available - see
the <a href="pubsub_protocol.html">PubSub Protocol</a> document.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p><samp>kn_subscribe("/chat",onChatMessage,{ do_max_age : 300
});</samp></p>

<h4><a id="3.3.2" name="3.3.2">3.3.2 kn_unsubscribe</a></h4>

<p>The kn_unsubscribe function is used to stop listening to events.
This is used for both messages being sent to a Web page as well as
messages being sent between topics on the server.</p>

<h5>Syntax</h5>

<p><code>function kn_unsubscribe(route)</code></p>

<dl>
<dt>route</dt>

<dd>The route URI returned from kn_subscribe.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Return Value</h5>

<p>None</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<blockquote>
<pre>
var route;

route = kn_subscribe("/chat", onChatMessage);
// route == "/chat/kn_routes/46165443"
kn_unsubscribe(route);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4><a id="3.3.3" name="3.3.3">3.3.3 kn_publish</a></h4>

<p>The kn_publish function is used to send a message to a topic,
and hence to all interested subscribers. The subscribers might be
in the same Web page, in other Web pages, on the same server, or on
other servers.</p>

<h5>Syntax</h5>

<p><code>function kn_publish(<var>topic</var>,
<var>event</var>)</code></p>

<dl>
<dt><var>topic</var></dt>

<dd>The destination topic. For example: "<samp>/chat</samp>".</dd>

<dt><var>event</var></dt>

<dd>The event object to publish. Properties of the event are:

<dl>
<dt>kn_payload</dt>

<dd>text string to send.</dd>

<dt>kn_id</dt>

<dd>globally unique identifier of the event. Optional. If not
specified, the server will generate a unique id. An event can be
modified by re-publishing an event with the same id. An event can
be removed by re-publishing an event with the same id and an empty
payload.</dd>

<dt>kn_expires</dt>

<dd>The time at which the event expires and is removed from the
system. Specified as the number of seconds since Thu Jan 1 00:00:00
1970 UTC (default: event creation time, e.g. <samp>979273892</samp>
for an event created at Fri Jan 12 04:31:32 2001 UTC). Use "+nnn"
format to specify a time in seconds relative to when the server
initially receives the message.</dd>

<dt><i>other</i></dt>

<dd>Custom value.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Return Value</h5>

<p><code>kn_id</code> of the event.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<p>The event object represents a message that is sent to all
listeners. All properties of <var>event</var> represent elements of
the message. We recommend that elements follow the naming and
meaning of HTTP headers when appropriate, using
<code>kn_payload</code> for message bodies. For example, a property
named "<code>content-type</code>" whose value is
"<samp>text/plain</samp>" would indicate to a receiver that the
<code>kn_payload</code> property is a text string.</p>

<p>However, since element names are case-sensitive, we recommend using
lowercase equivalents of the analogous HTTP header names.</p>

<p>Each event property has a name and a value. Both are strings.
While the names of event properties are most convenient to use when
they consist of lower-case letters, numbers, and underscores, they
may include any Unicode character. The values of event properties
are similarly unrestricted.</p>

<p>Event property names beginning with '<samp>kn_</samp>' are reserved
for future use by the PubSub Protocol. In addition, the name
'<code>do_method</code>' is reserved for mod_pubsub commands.</p>

<h4><a id="3.3.4" name="3.3.4">3.3.4 kn_publishAsSoap</a></h4>

<p>The <code>kn_publishAsSoap</code> function, provided by the <a
href="libdocs/kn_xml.js.html">kn_xml.js</a> library, sends
a JavaScript object as a SOAP message.</p>

<p>See section <a href="#3.5">3.5</a></p>

<h5>Syntax</h5>

<p><code>function kn_publishAsSoap(<var>topic</var>,
<var>name</var>, <var>object</var> [,
<var>elements</var>])</code></p>

<dl>
<dt><var>topic</var></dt>

<dd>The destination topic. For example: "<samp>/chat</samp>".</dd>

<dt><var>name</var></dt>

<dd>The name of the object. This is used as the name of the only
element inside the SOAP Body tag.</dd>

<dt><var>object</var></dt>

<dd>The object to send.</dd>

<dt><var>elements</var></dt>

<dd>Extra elements to be sent with the message. These elements are
required for a SOAP message to be properly routed to a SOAP server.
See section <a href="#3.4">3.4</a> for a list of valid and required
elements.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This function will send a new event with
'<code>kn_payload</code>', '<code>content-type</code>' and
'<code>soapaction</code>' elements, in addition to the elements
always present in a new event.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<blockquote>
<pre>
function postStatus()
{
    kn_publishAsSoap("/mike/status", "status",
                     {userid: "mike", status: "On Vacation"});
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4><a id="3.3.5" name="3.3.5">3.3.5 filter_message</a></h4>

<p>The <code>filter_message</code> function will convert SOAP
messages in the format produced by <code>kn_publishAsSoap</code>
into JavaScript objects.</p>

<p>See section <a href="#3.5">3.5</a>.</p>

<h5>Syntax</h5>

<p><code>function filter_message(event)</code></p>

<dl>
<dt><var>event</var></dt>

<dd>The event received.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Return value</h5>

<p>This function modifies its input parameter and returns it; it
adds a '<code>body</code>' property whose value is a copy of the
structure that was serialized to produce the SOAP Body element.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<blockquote>
<pre>
function onMessage(event)
{
    var msg = filter_message(event);
    if (msg.body.offer.kind == "buy" &amp;&amp;
        msg.body.offer.price &gt; 800)
    {
        alert("We've got a live one!");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3><a id="3.4" name="3.4">3.4. mod_pubsub message properties</a></h3>

<p>Messages delivered by mod_pubsub contain the same information that
was initially published, plus additional properties added by mod_pubsub.
Some properties are always present, while other are only present if
applicable.</p>

<h4>Message properties defined by mod_pubsub</h4>

<dl>
<dt><code>kn_id</code></dt>

<dd>Globally unique identifier of the event.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_time_t</code></dt>

<dd>Time the event occurred. Specified in standard C
<code>time_t</code> notation: seconds since the end of 1969 UTC.
Added by mod_pubsub if not initially present.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_payload</code></dt>

<dd>By convention, the body of the message.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_expires</code></dt>

<dd>Time the event expires, in the same format as
<code>kn_time_t</code>. Only present if <code>kn_expires</code> was
specified when the event was originally published.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_route_location</code></dt>

<dd>The route the message traveled through. This will not be
present if the event was published directly to the topic being
listened to.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Suggested message properties</h4>

<dl>
<dt><code>userid</code></dt>

<dd>Identifier for the user that generated the event. This comes
from the login name specified during authentication. If no
authentication takes place, this will be 'anonymous'. This property
is set by the JavaScript library.</dd>

<dt><code>displayname</code></dt>

<dd>Human-readable name for the user that generated the event.
Currently used by the Chat client.</dd>

<dt><code>content-type</code></dt>

<dd>Specifies the format of <code>kn_payload</code>. Use standard MIME
format names such as <samp>text/plain</samp> and
<samp>text/xml</samp>. This property is set by the
<code>kn_publishAsSoap</code> function from the PubSub JavaScript
Library.</dd> </dl>

<h3><a id="3.5" name="3.5">3.5. Using SOAP</a></h3>

<p>The PubSub JavaScript helper libraries include support for sending
and receiving SOAP-formatted XML messages. There is also support for
converting received SOAP-formatted XML messages into JavaScript
objects. Once these messages are objects, accessing the properties
within the SOAP message becomes extremely simple.</p>

<p>Include the JavaScript SOAP and XML support in your application
using the following tag:</p>

<p><code>&lt;script
src="../KN/kn_xml.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<h4><a id="3.5.1" name="3.5.1">3.5.1 Sending messages</a></h4>

<p>(Note: SOAP connections to third party services are not
currently implemented.)</p>

<p>Sending SOAP messages is as simple as sending a JavaScript object via
the <code>kn_publishAsSoap</code> function. For a message to be
published to a third-party SOAP service, the following elements must be
added:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>soap_uri</code></dt>

<dd>Used to indicate the URI header in a SOAP request.</dd>

<dt><code>soap_method</code></dt>

<dd>The remote method to invoke with the SOAP request.</dd>

<dt><code>soap_endpoint</code></dt>

<dd>The remote endpoint URL to publish the SOAP event to.</dd>

<dt><code>kn_next_hop</code></dt>

<dd>Where the SOAP response should be published to. If the original
topic subscribed to was <samp>/soap</samp>, then the response
should be another distinct topic such as
<samp>/soap/response</samp>.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Example</h5>

<blockquote>
<pre>
function postOffer()
{
    var obj = new Object();
    obj.kind = "buy";
    obj.price = "1000";
    kn_publishAsSoap("/auction", "offer", obj);
}

function postStatus()
{
    var obj = new Object();
    var elements = new Object();
    obj.userid = "mike";
    obj.status = "On Vacation";
    elements.soap_uri = "urn:mikes-user-status";
    elements.soap_method = "GetUser";
    elements.soap_endpoint = "http://my-example.com/soap";
    kn_publishAsSoap("/mike/status", "status", obj, elements);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When a page receives this message, the object that was sent can
be accessed via the "<code>body</code>" property of the message.
Sub-properties are accessed via the same names as in the original
object. For example: <samp>msg.body.offer.price</samp> and
<samp>msg.body.offer.kind</samp>.</p>

<p>When publishing an object as SOAP, you need to provide the name
of the object. This will become an element inside the SOAP Body.</p>

<h4><a id="3.5.2" name="3.5.2">3.5.2 Receiving messages</a></h4>

<p>Each message handler should translate messages into objects with
the <code>filter_message</code> function. Once translated, the
"<code>body</code>" property will hold a JavaScript object that was
created from the SOAP of the incoming event.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
function onMessage(event)
{
    var msg = filter_message(event);
    alert("The offer price is "+msg.body.offer.price);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The "<code>body</code>" property corresponds to the Body element
within the Envelope element of a SOAP message.</p>

<p>Given the event described in <a href="#3.5.1">the previous
section</a>, you could access its contents via the properties
<code>msg.body.offer.kind</code> and
<code>msg.body.offer.price</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
function onMessage(event)
{
    var msg = filter_message(event);
    if (msg.body.offer.kind == "buy" &amp;&amp;
        msg.body.offer.price &gt; 800)
    {
        alert("We've got a live one!");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
