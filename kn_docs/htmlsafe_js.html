<h1>htmlsafe.js Helper Library</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>We wanted to allow people using the chat client to post little
snippets of <small>HTML</small>. But we were afraid that allowing
unrestricted <small>HTML</small> posting would pose threats to
users: bits of user-posted JavaScript being run inadvertently by
other users. So we wrote an <small>HTML</small> parser which leaves
in ``safe'' <small>HTML</small> tags and removes potentially
dangerous tags.</p>

<h2>Usage synopsis</h2>

<blockquote>
<pre>
document.write(
    entifyUTF16(
        htmlSanitize(
            some_possibly_malicious_string_of_HTML_received_over_the_network,
            1)));
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>External interfaces</h2>

<h3><code>htmlSanitize(<em>string</em>,
<em>autohtml</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Given an <small>HTML</small> <code><em>string</em></code>, returns a
string that can occur in a well-formed and valid <small>XHTML</small>
document, doesn't contain any active JavaScript, and subject to these
constraints, is as similar to the original string as possible. The
optional <code><em>autohtml</em></code> parameter, if true, specifies
that <small>URL</small>s should be turned into their
<small>XHTML</small> equivalents.</p>

<h3><code>entifyUTF16(<em>string</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Given a Unicode string in <small>UTF</small>-16 or
<small>UCS</small>, this returns a string with non-<small>ASCII</small>
characters represented with <small>SGML</small> numeric character
entities. The resulting string is strictly <small>ASCII</small>, and so
it can be passed around safely through any 7-bit clean channel; you
don't have to worry about what character set it's assumed to be encoded
in, as long as it's a superset of <small>ASCII</small>. When the string
is rendereed in a Latin-1-capable browser, the numeric entities for
Latin-1 characters will be rendered as the correct characters; when
passed to a Unicode-capable browser, all the numeric entities will be
rendered as the correct characters.</p>

<h2>Internal definitions</h2>

<h3><code>urlstrings</code></h3>

<p>These are regular expressions used by <code>htmlSanitize</code>
to recognize <small>URL</small>s in order to automatically turn
them into links.</p>

<h3><code>tokenize(<em>tokenPatterns</em>,
<em>string</em>)</code></h3>

<p>This returns an array of ``tokens'' made from a chunk of text.
<code><em>tokenPatterns</em></code> specifies how to tokenize ---
it's an array of ^-anchored regular expressions that specify, in
order of preference, what kinds of things are desired as tokens. It
breaks chunks off the string using
<code><em>tokenPatterns</em></code> until the string is all gone;
then it returns the array of string chunks. We're almost pretending
that the chunks of text are opaque token objects, and we usually
use functions like <code>htmlTagName</code> and
<code>isHtmlOpenTag</code> to examine them.</p>

<p><code>htmlSanitize</code> uses this function to break up its
input text into ``safe'' <small>HTML</small> tags,
<small>SGML</small> entities, <small>URL</small>s, and individual
characters of text, not part of any of the above.</p>

<h3><code>htmlemptytags</code></h3>

<p>This regular expression matches the ``safe'' tags that don't
have any content, and therefore don't need closing tags, except for
<code>img</code>.</p>

<h3><code>htmlimgtags</code></h3>

<p>This regular expression matches ``safe'' <code>img</code>
tags.</p>

<h3><code>entities</code></h3>

<p>This regular expression matches <small>SGML</small>
entities.</p>

<h3><code>htmltokens</code></h3>

<p>This array of regular expressions gets passed as
<code><em>tokenPatterns</em></code> to <code>tokenize</code> by
<code>htmlSanitize</code>; it specifies the kinds of tokens we're
interested in, including a detailed list of the <small>HTML</small>
tags considered safe.</p>

<h3><code>htmlTagName(<em>string</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Given an <small>HTML</small> start tag token, this function
returns the lowercased name of the tag.</p>

<h3><code>isHtmlOpenTag(<em>string</em>)</code></h3>

<p>This function returns true if the token passed to it is an
<small>HTML</small> open tag.</p>

<h3><code>isHtmlCloseTag(<em>string</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Likewise, but for close tags.</p>

<h3><code>isHtmlCloseLastTag(<em>string</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Likewise, but for <small>SGML</small> empty close tags
&lt;/&gt;.</p>

<h3><code>htmlOpenTag(<em>tagname</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns an <small>HTML</small> open tag with the specified tag
name. Only useful because JavaScript doesn't have any kind of
string quasiquotation.</p>

<h3><code>htmlCloseTag(<em>tagname</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Likewise, but for a close tag.</p>

<h3><code>htmlEmptyTag(<em>tagname</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Likewise, but generates an <small>XHTML</small> &lt;empty /&gt;
tag.</p>

<h3><code>closeElement(<em>stack</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Pops the top tagname off the end of the
<code><em>stack</em></code> (an Array, with the top of the stack at
the end) and returns an <small>HTML</small> close tag for it.</p>

<h3><code>findTagInStack(<em>tag</em>, <em>stack</em>)</code></h3>

<p>Given a tagname, searches in the stack for an instance of that
tag, and returns its index. To comply with <small>HTML</small>
specifications, &lt;a&gt; elements can't be nested, so whenever
we're going to generate an &lt;a&gt; start tag, we use this
function to find any enclosing &lt;a&gt; elements and close
them.</p>
