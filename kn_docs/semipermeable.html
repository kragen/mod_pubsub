<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
lightweight content management systems known as weblogs or blogs have
enjoyed a massive popularity explosion in the past few years, more or
less becoming a distinct literary form.  But although the blog has
proven itself <I>technically</I> capable of meeting the need for many
kinds of information dissemination and archiving, numerous social and
legal problems have emerged in the practice of real-world blogging. 
Many of these problems cluster around the almost totally public
nature of online expression.  Paradoxically, we may be reaching a
point where greater expression can only be achieved through greater
privacy.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Online
privacy is ultimately a matter of law; but the law develops within an
understanding of specific technical capabilities.  Software
implementors can, should, and increasingly do design towards
social-engineering goals, such as the ability to withstand legal
challenge.  Design from high-level needs is particularly relevant in
the case of blogware, where a large percentage of users are not
themselves admins or developers and therefore usability is a primary
concern -- perhaps <I>the</I> primary concern.  The combination of
sophisticated social goal and need for usability means that the state
of the law must be baked into blogware tools themselves – a
daunting challenge for any development team.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another
major area for improvement in weblog software is integration with
other communications apps:  other people's blogs, bulletin boards,
Wikis, chat, IM, email, PIMs, external websites, and RSS aggregators.
 At the moment users are habituated to monitoring numerous apps –
and ceding control over their private and/or copyrighted data to
numerous external organizations -- to manage their personal
communications, but it should be possible in theory to reduce the
number of interfaces.  This step would help move the web towards its
ultimate goal of facilitating a seamless conversation regardless of
the form in which data is presented.  Integration of communication
apps might also habituate people to the value of controlling their
own data, being able to choose with whom and under what conditions to
share it – which comes back to the overarching goal of using
technology to enhance privacy.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We
believe that asynchronous publish and subscribe messaging frameworks
like mod_pubsub<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym">[1]</A>
could offer a substantially improved architecture towards the goal of
carving out spaces of privacy on the Internet.  Instead of monolithic
public weblogs, semi-permeable blogging offers the promise of
numerous levels of online privacy which can offer the preconditions
for certain desired privacy protections.  This paper will focus on
the general problem of privacy in social software like weblogs; a
follow-up paper will detail mod-pubsub's design for semi-permeable
blogware.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I
wish to emphasize that I am not a lawyer, nor are any of the members
of the mod-pubsub group at this time.  We are software developers who
are interested in needs that come from “high on the stack”, in
the social-engineering layers.  Furthermore, many of the issues
discussed in this paper have barely begun to work their way through
the legislative and justice systems of our project's home (the United
States of America).  Therefore, much of what we've read about these
issues tends to be promulgated by advocacy groups, law professors,
and other interested parties whose interpretations may be incomplete,
biased, unpopular, or otherwise unlikely to be implemented.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As
these examples suggest, blogging in its current form constitutes
fully public speech.  Although this realm of expression is protected
from certain forms of government suppression, at least in most
advanced nations, there is no guarantee of freedom from criminal
investigation, civil liability, subtle discrimination, or social
ostracism resulting from information voluntarily revealed in public. 
In other words, there is no expectation of privacy on the Internet<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym">[2]</A>
at this point.  As long as you can be tracked via a subpoena, you can
be held liable for offenses ranging from terrorism and treason, to
securities fraud, libel, and sexual harassment, to violating the
terms of your employment agreement.  Any information you reveal can
also be used to your detriment if seen by potential or current
employers, romantic candidates, people you're arguing with online,
relatives, etc.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
full publicness of the web has been exacerbated by the predelictions
and interests of the pioneers.  Early blogging, for instance, was
marked by the heavy overrepresentation of three groups that are
atypical in their privacy needs:  academics, who basically cannot be
fired for intellectually meaningful public statements<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym">[3]</A>;
independent web developers, who can be helped by controversy more
than they are hurt by lack of discretion; and individuals who are
interested in experimenting with publicness as a quasi-artistic
theme, like webcam operators.  At the same time, commercial websites
encouraged users to contribute as much personal information as they
could be persuaded to part with:  product reviews, personal profiles,
email archives, wishlists, evaluations of other users, etc.  By a
confluence of these factors, the gut-level assumption was established
that the web was somehow “naturally” an arena of fully-public
discourse.  At this point, many people who desire even a modicum of
privacy in online exchanges have been cowed into apologetic
submission by numerous curt admonitions not to express themselves
online at all if they aren't prepared to deal with the consequences
of a public medium.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Stepping
back from things as they currently are, it should be clear that fully
public speech is not the only imaginable or even the optimal level of
privacy necessary on the Internet.  The vast majority of people
express themselves in greater quantity and often greater quality if
they are allowed to freely choose the level of publicness of each of
their utterances.  In the real world, you almost certainly feel more
comfortable discussing certain topics – political controversies, or
the shortcomings of your company's management team, or your marital
problems – in an environment where you can control who hears you,
for instance at a dinner party with old and trusted friends; or in an
environment where you have legal guarantees of confidentiality, as in
a therapist's office.  Why should the Internet be different?  Privacy
in the real world results in greater and truer expression, and it may
do so in the online world too – if we application developers can
build the proper environments to enable it.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
various levels of online privacy that should be handled gracefully by
social software include:</FONT></P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 1.63cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1.  Totally private information. 
	Obviously the realm of the traditional diary -- innermost thoughts
	and feelings -- falls in this category.  It may also include data
	that the user wishes to archive but not share with others, such as
	daily body weight (and alcohol units, for Bridget Jones).</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 1.65cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2.  Information primarily intended for

</UL>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
desire to carve out these various levels of privacy in an essentially
public medium has bred a plethora of cute, if largely ineffectual,
strategies.  The most common is simple anonymity (usually actually
pseudonymity, but why quibble), or privacy through obscurity.  It's
surprisingly common for someone who has developed a strong online
persona to find that identity confining, and wish to start afresh in
some other patch of Blogistan -- generally by starting a completely
separate and unpublicized blog.  Other novice bloggers start out
anonymous from the beginning, although many of them break cover
later.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Unfortunately,
anonymity turns out to be almost infinitely frangible and certainly
incompatible with any significant amount of visibility.  Numerous
bloggers have lost their jobs due to their writing activity<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym">[4]</A>
-- although it must be noted that none of these bloggers attempted to
lie or stonewall, which might have shifted the burden of
investigation to the employer, or to seek redress after the fact; and
most of the employers were small businesses which tend to have less
sophisticated HR policies because they incur less employment-related
liability.  Other bloggers have evidently been threatened with loss
of employment<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym">[5]</A>,
or even in the most extreme cases political prison<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym">[6]</A>.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Probably
the major issue with pseudonymous blogging is that the community
tends to discount the opinions of those who explicitly want to avoid
all the consequences of having expressed them in public, or even to
suspect such individuals of troll-like intentions.  This scorn is
particularly marked in the realm of political blogging (aka
warblogging), where the refusal to stand behind one's opinions for
all to see can leave the writer open to endless personal
imprecations.  Anonymity and pseudonymity are also especially
unappreciated by sites which rely heavily on personal reputation
within a community, such as WikiWikiWeb (which maintains a
“RealNamesPlease” policy) and Slashdot (which famously forces
unregistered contributions to be signed “Anonymous Coward”). 
When the reputations of those using real names can be harmed more
than those using pseudonyms – who can always walk away from a
particular identity, and establish a new one; or even use multiple
identities to game the system – social trust mechanisms are liable
to break down in a classic iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
difficulty of discretion is increased by search engine caching and
the Wayback Machine, which ensure there is no definitive mechanism to
change or delete a post permanently.  Once a blog entry has escaped
from the private sphere into the wild, there is no way to guarantee
that every trace of it has been eradicated from the public realm. 
Also, some corrective mechanisms that have evolved in the context of
journalism or academic publishing to reduce liability, such as
editing or retraction, have not yet found any firm legal footing in
the world of weblogs.  Generally a public retraction will stave off a
libel or defamation lawsuit in the world of journalism, but no one
yet knows whether it has the same effect in the blogging world.  In
fact, some netizens are vociferously opposed to the practice of
editing electronic content in place.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Invisiblog
is a recent technical twist on the anonymity strategy.  It employs
PGP and anonymous remailers to effectively erase the tracks of the
writer.  The staff of Invisiblog never knows the identity or even
(definitively) the IP address of any given blogger, although
obviously if one is foolish enough to use one's public PGP key all
bets are off.  However, Invisiblog does warn its users that it will
comply with court orders as technically possible – for instance,
those directing them to remove content from their servers.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another
strategy to deal with different levels of privacy is the use of
multiple weblogs, or multiple sections of one weblog.  This may be
combined with some kind of disclaimer<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym">[7]</A>
and/or robots.txt files, as means to indicate that a particular
section contains material which should not be spidered by search
engines or read by those whose relationship with the author is
strictly professional.  Unfortunately, this strategy entirely depends
upon voluntary compliance by viewers; and human nature being what it
is, identifying and segregating one's juiciest blog posts is not
exactly the most efficacious method to discourage snoops.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A
third privacy-seeking technique is to restrict access to other
registered members of an online community.  The problems that arise
from this technique are generally not legal, but social ones caused
by a violation of the writer's assumption that what is said inside
the group should stay inside the group.  There is no technical means
of preventing a bona-fide member of the group from revealing the
details of your weekend in Vegas to your girlfriend.  Small
communities being what they are, the anonymous letter -- or rather
the anonymous printout or cut-and-paste of a screenful of weblog text
– seems to have (re)emerged as the technique of choice for in-group
payback.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because
these problems occur in the context of a service it's generally not
possible for the blogger, who does not control the machinery of the
server, to identify potential rats well enough to deter or punish
them.  In some cases it's also not clear who effectively controls
these expressions.  The actual service provider is usually considered
a “publisher” or common carrier in the United States, and thus
assiduously shuns the legal burdens of content ownership by means of
disclaimers; but almost always retains the power to pull offending
posts if presented with a legal demand to do so.  Some websites also
reserve the right to reprint their users' content in various forms –
potentially exposing it to a wider or different audience than the
author intended -- or even sell it back to the user under certain
conditions.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A
restricted-access blog is considered undesirable because it limits
the potential egoboo afforded to bloggers.  There is a very clear
tension experienced by every novice blogger between the payoff of
openness -- the thrill of knowing strangers could be reading your
words -- and that of discretion -- reducing legal and social
liability.  It must be noted that restricted-access blogs are
currently seen as platforms for the very young to maintain trivial
online diaries -- sort of a blog with training wheels, for people who
are not quite ready for the risks and responsibilities of truly
public speech.  Only a few blogging communities (notably LiveJournal)
offer any means to restrict access on a per-post basis to a list of
chosen viewers, while maintaining all the advantages of an otherwise
public blog.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As
far as anyone can tell, it has not become common to preserve privacy
by loading blog software onto only locally-accessible machines for a
true &quot;Dear Diary&quot; experience.  Although this is technically
feasible, it probably requires a level of technical sophistication
that appears to still be uncommon in the blogging world.  Also,
perhaps truly private blogging by itself is too cut off from the rest
of the world to be a compelling application of the technology. 
People who sincerely want privacy write in locked notebooks, they do
not put messages into tiny virtual bottles and cast them upon the
waters.  Obviously it's hard to get hard numbers on how many people
use blog software locally, but the fact that so few talk about it in
their public blogs would seem to indicate the rarity of the practice.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We
want to re-emphasize that although there are certainly bloggers who
could potentially face criminal prosecution for online activities,
the vast majority merely seeks protection from civil liability or
social sanction.  Blog software can and should meet the felt needs of
individuals who wish to bitch about work without risking termination,
discuss technical issues without being slapped with a DMCA violation,
gossip about mutual acquaintances without incurring of a libel suit,
or record their struggles with mental illness without fear of being
judged an insurance liability.  All of these forms of expression are
legal, common, and usually enjoy some expectation of privacy on the
telephone or in face-to-face conversation in one's home, where
generally only a criminal warrant can penetrate the expectation of
privacy.  Although ultimately the question of privacy on the web
belongs to the courts, technical experiments must be built before
legal theories can be tested.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus
far, the few weblogs that make any serious attempt to ensure privacy
do so by means of simple password protection:  either web server
access control, or database plus cookie/session authentication. 
However, the law has not yet definitively decided whether this type
of access control establishes an expectation of privacy – and if
so, how much and under what circumstances.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
main case to make it to a higher court in the United States thus far,
<I>Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines</I>, resulted in a notably confusing
decision which is still being argued over by legal scholars<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym">[8]</A>;
but the original case has still mostly not been decided on its
merits, the defendant has now entered bankruptcy, and the plaintiff
has indicated that he might appeal part of the circuit court
decision<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym">[9]</A>.
 The opinion seems to hold that unauthorized access to a website
which requires  unique usernames and passwords provided by the site
operator, and also requires all viewers to accept a click-through
user agreement prohibiting disclosure to third parties, can
constitute a violation of the Stored Communications Act, which allows
the website owner to bring suit against the intruder in Federal
court.  However, the SCA may not apply if a legitimate habitual user
of the site allows an unauthorized third party to use his or her
username and password to access the site.  Also, the content on the
password-protected website may still potentially be found defamatory
– it was not in <I>Konop</I>, but that may have been specifically
due to the fact that the two parties were engaged in a labor dispute.
 Finally, even if content is obtained from a web server illegally, a
recent case called <I>US v. Jarrett</I> suggests that it might still
be available as evidence in a criminal case.  As this account should
make clear, this is very much a developing area of the law -- and no
one can be certain exactly how it will develop.  Even if the courts
eventually decide that password-protection affords some privacy,
there are numerous means of circumventing this intention in practice
for those willing to risk the possible penalties.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
Supreme Court may (or may not) make online privacy possible, in the
sense of offering some protection from lawsuits and prosecution under
certain conditions -- but strong crypto lets you be <I>sure</I>. 
Rather than relying simply on authentication, more privacy may be
gained by the use of two-way encryption.  In addition to the
technical advantages, this strategy takes advantage of an unintended
consequence of the DMCA, which criminalizes any attempt to break a
cryptographic system intended to protect copyright.  Since a
blogger's intention is to prevent any unauthorized user from
reproducing his or her words in any form -- especially in an
indictment or subpoena -- presumably DMCA could apply to weblogs.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But
given that basic auth is too technically challenging for the vast
majority of bloggers today, cryptographically-based blog privacy will
never get any traction unless software is written that handles all
the machinery of cryptography transparently.  Also, we should mention
that crypto may be about to undergo a period of rigorous testing by
both legal and technical means, with a possible result that the USA
will try to exert control over strong crypto schemes such as PGP
again soon.  Militating against this, crypto has become big business
and it's difficult to see how Washington's untechnical minions will
craft legislation of sufficient fineness to distinguish between a
legitimate business use of cryptography and any other use.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There
are two main technologies for encrypting Internet data:  SSL and PGP
(there's also SSH, but that is tied to user accounts and will not be
considered here).  For these purposes, SSL suffers from requiring a
separate user-authentication system.  It also is not fully anonymous
if used two-way:  certificates must be issued for both server and
client by a third-party which verifies certain information about both
sides.  SSL was largely designed to help the browser user trust the
host website enough to transmit private information to the server,
not the other way around.  And finally, SSL certificates are not very
portable, being deliberately difficult to transfer between
applications and hosts.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">PGP
has not yet been applied to web communications on any large scale,
but in theory it offers some advantages over SSL.  In effect, it
provides a built-in authentication system -- possibly a higher level
one since social trust mechanisms can theoretically be applied. 
However, for maximum privacy it would be better to use only keys not
registered with the public key servers – the lack of intermediaries
being another virtue of PGP.  PGP keys are portable and easy to
transfer from one application or host to the next, because they are
tied to an individual or identity rather than to a domain.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It
should be mentioned that the laws affecting compelled disclosure --
forcibly turning over PGP keys, passphrases, and decrypted messages
-- have yet to be settled in the USA.  So far, the few test cases
that have emerged have all been criminal investigations (notably <I>US
v. Scarfo</I>) rather than civil offenses.  The balance of opinion at
this time seems to be that in the USA one cannot be compelled to
self-incriminate due to the Fifth Amendment, but probably can be
compelled to provide plain-text copies of subpoenaed documents,
especially in cases where one is not oneself the defendant.  In the
UK, residents <I>can</I> be compelled to turn over PGP keys in a
criminal investigation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act, which also prohibits the key user from revoking or otherwise
reporting the invalidation of the key.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another
factor affecting privacy is the architecture of the web, particularly
the fixed location of the web server and of content on that server. 
Because web servers are almost always found at fixed IP addresses,
it's childishly easy to pinpoint the party to be served with a legal
demand.  One subpoena, or sometimes just a WHOIS lookup, is all it
takes to identify the entity that can pull the plug<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym">[10]</A>.
 Given that security is less about absolutes than about increasing
the level of difficulty, it might be helpful for a system to be
designed which is more distributed and easy to move around.  Ideally,
the physical location of a blog could be changed frequently to elude
surveillance, or it might exist in multiple locations, or in pieces
scattered throughout a distributed network.  When an authorized
visitor connects with a valid PGP key, the web server might forward a
request to some other location without actually storing or vending
any content itself.  Content on the wire may have more legal
protection than content inscribed to a disk, as it may require a
wiretapping warrant to access<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym">[11]</A>;
therefore, making it more difficult to identify and seize a physical
copy of the content could be a potentially useful tactic.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym">[12]</A></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There
is no easy way to prevent authorized users from printing or
cutting-and-pasting text from a browser.  One could potentially
deliver a blog page in PDF or other binary format, which makes
cutting and pasting more difficult, but this does not deter printing.
 This issue really lies in the realm of social engineering, and
therefore is resistant to technical solution.  It's possible that
some kind of restrictive terms of use might have legal force, but so
far this idea has not been fully tested in court.  The best a piece
of blog software can do is make it easier to narrow down the specific
user who violated the veil of privacy.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Although
we have mostly focused our discussion on individual privacy, the
kinds of changes we are proposing could have benefits for businesses
also.  For instance, if software could be designed which carved out a
certain level of legally-tested privacy for users connecting with
known PGP keys, IT security concerns could be squared with the ease
of the outside-the-firewall Internet.  Currently a mass of
proprietary data – HR documents and forms, buglists and version
control systems, Wikis and knowledgebases – must reside behind the
corporate firewall because  it contains proprietary information.  The
technical solutions to this problem, which include VPNs and ssh, are
difficult to implement and monitor properly.  The kinds of
architectural changes we propose could potentially enhance the
security of proprietary corporate information as well as private
personal data.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Integrating blogging with other
applications</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
current distinction between communications applications is not fully
necessary, and leads to numerous inefficiencies.  A given user may
need to monitor and employ email (including Trackback/Pingback and
comment notifications for his or her own blog, as well as emails sent
by readers and update notifications from other people's blogs), a
chat window, numerous IM windows, multiple weblogs and Wikis and
individual threads from those blogs and Wikis, one's own blogware
system, a PIM, other websites (for instance those that accept
copyrighted product reviews), and possibly an RSS aggregator to
participate in the full range of desirable online conversations.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For
instance, at the moment there is no truly elegant way to track
comment activity on other people's weblogs, or even to keep track of
which posts you've commented on recently -- much less get some kind
of quick notification when someone specifically replies to one of
your comments.  Of course, one can see why the makers of current
weblogs might not want to implement systems which might result in
tons of spam flying around, much of it from their own servers.  Email
is undergoing a phase where it has become a victim of its own
success, in that spam filters are now totally mandatory, but they
tend to assume that lots of email from any given address increases
the likelihood that it's being used by a spammer.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There
is no technical reason why an individual could not sit in front of a
single application window and interact with all the different kinds
of communication software mentioned above in near-realtime.  It's all
just data and endpoints, and once these two become decoupled the
necessity for multiple viewing applications can disappear if desired.
 Of course this deconstruction is much simpler in a publish and
subscribe architecture than in the inflexible display-oriented
architecture of current weblogs.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It
would also be highly desirable to extend the kinds of privacy
protections under discussion from weblogs to other communications
applications.  The state of privacy practice in other communication
applications is truly deplorable.  Blogs are at least understood to
be public by most people, even if perhaps they don't fully grasp all
the implications.  In contrast, the vast majority of users of IM,
email, and chat apps behave as if these channels of communication are
equivalent to the telephone.  Even telephone conversations have a
reduced expectation of privacy in certain situations, such as in the
workplace; but email and IM have absolutely none.  Email in
particular, but also IM and browsing, are fully susceptible to
surveillance by the employer and potentially by the third-party owner
of the server, and increasingly constitute important evidence in
legal cases.  Nevertheless, many employees transmit confidential and
private information over these channels routinely with no attempts at
concealment or discretion.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The
good news is that considerable work has already been done to enhance
privacy in email and IM, if not necessarily to make it user-friendly.
 As we will discuss in the the followup technical paper, it should be
possible to build blog privacy on the foundation of technologies
proven in other applications.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally,
one particular way in which we believe pub/sub will enhance privacy
is by returning control of an individual's data to that individual. 
People – not users, people – should be able to choose with whom
and under what circumstances they wish to share their personal
details and insights.  They should also be helped in keeping track of
what they said where.  As individuals establish long-lived online
identities with contributions scattered all over the Internet, the
slippage between copyright and control becomes ever more apparent: 
in theory an individual owns his or her own expressions, but in
practice they have become part of the body of a website owned by
another person or entity – and therefore under the control of that
person or entity, and possibly subject to foreign law.  Only by
personal archiving, independent of the original publisher of each
contribution, can an individual maintain control over his or her
online identity over time.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For
instance, it is fairly well established that all my comments on
various US-based community websites exist under my copyright; but
those website operators can sometimes choose to edit or be compelled
to delete my copyrighted material<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym">[13]</A>
– and I will not even be able to contest the action in public
without a copy of my original post.  A website could also go out of
business or be shut down, causing the loss of all content contributed
by me.  By simply being able to route my comments through my own
server, which would post it to my own blog and then transparently
forward a copy to the website in question, I could make sure that I
had a copy of every single thing I posted to any website anywhere on
the Internet.  If for some reason I wanted to share that same piece
of writing with some other person or website, I could do so with
another subscription.  In this way, integrating blogs with other web
applications could enhance individual control over personal data –
which is also an important privacy concern.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Simon Winchester, in his recent book
<I>Krakatoa</I>, mentions a telling fact about the development of
undersea telegraphy in the 19th century:  despite the fact
that overland cables were already available and cheaper, demand for
undersea telegraph grew rapidly.  The real value-add of submarine
cable, according to Winchester, was privacy and security:  the
deep-sea lines were thought to be impossible to tap and less likely
to be susceptible to operator theft of secrets, unlike overland
cables which passed through a multitude of jurisdictions and through
numerous hands before reaching their destination.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A similar story can be told about the
growth of private postal services (meaning those carrying
non-governmental mail) in Renaissance Europe.  By the turn of the
15th century, successful merchants were exchanging around
10,000 letters a year with business associates in multiple
countries<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="#sdfootnote14sym">[14]</A>.
 One of the factors accounting for the explosive rise of
letter-writing at this time was the development of private postal
services (most notably that run by the Thurn und Taxis family) which
were considered neutral networks.  The vast and enduring success of
these private postal services indicates a demand for a common carrier
that was subject to neither governmental snooping nor competitive
industrial espionage.  One of the reasons centralized European
governments later nationalized postal monopolies was in fact to
maintain better surveillance on possible dissident elements.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As these historical examples suggest, in
the past the promise of privacy in communication media has led to an
increase in expression.  For this reason, we think it rather unlikely
that increased privacy would lead to a disastrous closing off of the
great conversation that is the Internet.  Instead, it will create
more rooms in the mansion:  those who wish can still shout their
ideas from the street, while others will choose to unburden
themselves only to trusted friends in their own living rooms. 
Obviously everyone hopes that bloggers will choose to keep much of
their expression public and free – but it should be each
individual's choice to make, aided by software that recognizes the
eternal tension between the human needs for freedom and privacy.</FONT></P>
