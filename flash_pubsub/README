I've been working (slowly) on the Flash PubSub Lib.
This is what i've got so far.

Two new classes:

The first is an extension of the XMLSocket object. It has some nice
features, like queueing send requests. It's a "0.1" release, so there
are still things that are going to change. This is the class that
connects, sends and receives data from the PubSub Server.

Second, I've built a helper PubSub data class, which is used to
construct the messages you'd send to the server.

The main PubSub class has yet to be built. I'm working on parsing of the
received data now, which is what the class will be responsible for (and
persistence, and... etc etc).

Check it out, let me know what you think. Work goes forward!

R 0.1 Notes:

- pubsubSocket and pubsubData class's are in a working state.
- Parsing of received data is missing.
- The "main" pubsub class is not done (this is where the data parsing will
be done, i think).
- I've got concerns about how when you send any data, other then a 'watch',
the socket is always closed after. Its a pain, and resource intensive to
have to re-connect for every data send. this may be another place to look to
the server to implement a "long term" socket connection when using Flash.
