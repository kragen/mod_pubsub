<h3 align=left>How to Demo</h3>

<p align=left>Open up copies of this PubSub page on several computers
and/or several browser windows simultaneously. Then, for every N events
and K peers, N*K*K acknowledgement events will be sent around so each
one can track which other peers have accepted delivery of each
event. </p>

<h3 align=left>Explanation</h3>

<p align=left>This sample demonstrates how to provide
guaranteed-delivery facilities at the application layer using
mod_pubsub. The point of a publish-and-subscribe system is to loosen the
coupling between the varied moving parts of&nbsp;a distributed,
decentralized process.&nbsp;The key to&nbsp;the scalability and
extensibility of event-based programming is that publisher
cannot&nbsp;know in advance all&nbsp;of the&nbsp;ways&nbsp;an event
might be&nbsp;delivered.

<blockquote align="left"><em>A useful analogy at this point is to
consider email. By sending a message to a mailing list, you can't
practically enumerate the set of people who will receive it. After all,
some of the "subscribers" may be other mailing lists, or even a
newspaper that prints a million copies on Sunday. There may be issues of
copyright, privacy, and economics deterring this (social, or
application-layer, conventions), but it's not SMTP's problem to chase
down every eventual recipient -- otherwise email wouldn't have scaled up
as far as it has.</em>

</blockquote>

<p align=left>However, it is important for some&nbsp;cooperating
applications to readily confirm delivery amongst themselves. Here, we
have modified Ping to allow multiple concurrent instances of the
application to require every connected peer to acknowledge each ping by
publishing a reply event.

<p align=left>Zack works as follows: first, every peer subscribes to a
common ping topic, but with a special Zack attribute indicating that it
complies with this new convention:

<pRE align="left">kn.subscribe(topic, handler, {zack : "true"});</pre>

<p align=left> The publisher of each event to be guaranteed also needs
to designate a call-back topic which it is monitoring to collect Zacks
at. Second, every peer needs to publish a Zack back to that collection
point. In this demo, it happens to be the same Zack-back topic for all,
so everyone sees every acknowledgement.

<pre>zackTopic = topic + "/zackback";

..

kn.publish(topic, {kn_payload... zackback: zackTopic});

..

function handler(e) {

    ...

    if (e.zackback)

        kn.publish(e.zackback, {zacking : e.kn_id});

}

</pre>

<p> All that's left to do is to modify the user interface to "count up"
which peers have acknowledged before proceeding. "View Source" if you
want to see the complete modifications.</P>

<p>Finally, it is an exercise for the reader to modify the application
to A) discover dynamically which subscribers of a topic support the Zack
protocol and B) require that <b>every</b> subscriber reply affirmatively
before proceeding to the next ping. Right now, the publisher races away
while the Zacks trickle in after the fact. Of course, such an exercise
will be complicated by the arrival and departure of "Zacking" listeners
during the test run &amp;c; these are well-known theoretical barriers to
offering meaningful "guaranteed-delivery" semantics over any pub-sub
system.

<!-- <p align=left> Then we also need to discover what other peers are
currently watch and support Zack. By subscribing to "topic/kn_routes" we
get a series of events describing each new subscription created; we
simply ignore any that don't include the Zack header:

<pre>

		kn.subscribe(topic + "/kn_routes/", watchers, 
{do_max_age : "infinity"});

		...

		function watchers(e) {

			if (e.zack) w[w.length] = e.kn_to;

		}

</pre> --></p>
