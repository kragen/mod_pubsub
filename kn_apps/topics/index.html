    This small utility application was written in response to the question,
    can I get a list of subtopics from the PubSub Server in my browser?

    To get a list of subtopics for a particular topic, subscribe to the
    "kn_subtopics" topic of that topic.  To get a full tree, simply do this
    recursively.  This is how applications like mod_pubsub/kn_apps/introspect/
    and mod_pubsub/kn_apps/subtopics/ work.

    The rest of this file is a demonstration of how to do this.

    By the way, once you've browsed the subtopics, you might decide that
    you want to delete an event on the PubSub server.  To delete an event,
    simply publish a new event with the same kn_id, an empty kn_payload,
    and kn_expires: "+0".  For example, this can be done in JavaScript with

       // delete event with kn_id "1234" from topic "/x/y/z"
       kn.publish( "/x/y/z", { kn_id: "1234", kn_expires: "+0", kn_payload: "" } );

    or, it can be done in the browser by typing in an URL such as

       http://mypubsubserver/kn/what/test/?do_method=notify&kn_id=1234&kn_expires=+0&kn_payload=
