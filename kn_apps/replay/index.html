<h1>Replay</h1>
<h2>A Multi-channel Event Stream Recorder</h2>

<p> Type in a name for your 'recorder'; type in channel(s) to
record.  When you stop recording, the BlackBox will unsubscribe from
each of the watched channels; the screen will go red until the tape has
stopped.  You can then press play, or come back later and type in the
name of the record to replay. </p>

<p> <b>FIXME: do_method=replay does not currently work. As a result,
this demo does not currently work.</b> </p>
