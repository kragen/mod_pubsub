<h1>JavaScript Options, Tricks and Debugging</h1>
<pre>

The PubSub JavaScript Library (a.k.a. do_method=lib or pubsub.js)
has a few tricks up its sleeve to aid in debugging and software
development. For the purposes of this discussion, we'll pretend your
mod_pubsub instance is in http://localhost/mod_pubsub/ -- if it's
somewhere else, change the URLs accordingly.




      =========================================================
        USING AND OVERRIDING LIBRARY AND APPLICATION DEFAULTS
      =========================================================

    PUBSUB JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY DEFAULTS: USER ID AND DISPLAY NAME

To get the user's ID and display name, use the JavaScript variables
kn.userid and kn.displayname:

  alert('Welcome, ' + kn.displayname + '!');
  if (kn.userid == 'guest') alert('Please stay as long as you like.');
<script type="text/javascript">
  alert('Welcome, ' + kn.displayname + '!');
  if (kn.userid == 'guest') alert('Please stay as long as you like.');
</script>



A specific user ID (as opposed to using one assigned by the mod_pubsub
instance or chosen by the PubSub JavaScript Library) can be chosen using
the kn_userid URL parameter. Similarly, a display name can be chosen
using the kn_displayname URL parameter. For example, to chat as the user
named "John Doe" with the ID "jdoe":

<a target="_top"
href="../chat1/?kn_userid=jdoe;kn_displayname=John%20Doe">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat1/?kn_userid=jdoe;kn_displayname=John%20Doe</a>

NOTE that the space between "John" and "Doe" was written as
"%20". In general, characters other than letters or numbers need to
be translated into bytes, and then written in hexadecimal -- preceded
by "%" -- when they appear in URL parameters. There's even a special
PubSub JavaScript Library function to do this for you, called
kn_escape(). For instance, kn_escape("John Doe") returns the string
"John%20Doe" (the kn_unescape() function translates the other way.)

Of course, a mod_pubsub instance may reject events published under an
assumed user ID and/or display name, or it may silently change the user
ID and display name of those events to match your real user ID and
display name.




                   APPLICATION DEFAULT: TOPIC NAME

If an application uses a default topic which may need to be overridden
from time to time, it should use the kn_argv.kn_topic variable:

  var topic = kn_argv.kn_topic;
  if (topic == null) topic = "/what/chat";
  var sent = false;
  kn.publish(topic,
             // event
             { userid: kn.userid, displayname: kn.displayname,
               kn_payload: kn.displayname + " sent a test message." },
             // status event handlers
             { onError: function(e) {
                          alert('Publish error for "' + topic + '": ' +
                                e.status) },
               onSuccess: function() { sent = true; }});
<script type="text/javascript">
  var topic = kn_argv.kn_topic;
  if (topic == null) topic = "/what/chat";
  var sent = false;
  kn.publish(topic,
             // event
             { userid: kn.userid, displayname: kn.displayname,
               kn_payload: kn.displayname + " has connected" },
             // status event handlers
             { onError: function(e) {
                          alert('Publish error for "' + topic + '": ' +
                                e.status) },
               onSuccess: function() { sent = true; }});
</script>



A specific topic may be chosen using the kn_topic URL parameter:

<a target="_top"
href="../chat1/?kn_topic=/what/elvis">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat1/?kn_topic=/what/elvis</a>

If the topic name doesn't start with "kn_", the "kn_topic=" may be
omitted:

<a target="_top"
href="../chat1/?/what/elvis/alive">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat1/?/what/elvis/alive</a>




                  APPLICATION DEFAULT: OLD EVENT AGE

Often, an application will use the "do_max_age" subscription parameter
to fetch old events. It's nice to be able to change the default
subscription age from time to time, so some applications support the
do_max_age URL parameter:

  var max_age = kn_argv.do_max_age;
  if (max_age == null) max_age = "3600"; // one hour, by default
  kn.subscribe(topic,
               // event handler
               { onMessage: function(e) {
                              got_events = got_events + 1;
                              alert(Date(1000 * e.kn_time_t) ': ' +
                              e.kn_payload);
                            }},
               // subscription parameters
               { do_max_age: max_age },
               // status event handlers
               { onError: function(e) {
                            alert('Subscribe error for "' + topic + '": ' +
                                  e.status) },
                 onSuccess: function() { alert('Got ' + got_events +
                                               'event(s) from the previous ' +
                                               max_age + ' seconds'); }});
<script type="text/javascript">
  var max_age = kn_argv.do_max_age;
  if (max_age == null) max_age = "3600"; // one hour, by default
  kn.subscribe(topic,
               // event handler
               { onMessage: function(e) {
                              got_events = got_events + 1;
                              alert(Date(1000 * e.kn_time_t) + ': ' +
                              e.kn_payload);
                            }},
               // subscription parameters
               { do_max_age: max_age },
               // status event handlers
               { onError: function(e) {
                            alert('Subscribe error for "' + topic + '": ' +
                                  e.status) },
                 onSuccess: function() { alert('Got ' + got_events +
                                               'event(s) from the previous ' +
                                               max_age + ' seconds'); }});
</script>



To adjust the number of old events, use the "do_max_age" URL parameter:

<a target="_top"
href="../chat2/?do_max_age=86400">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat2/?do_max_age=86400</a>

This would replay all events from the previous 24 hours.





                           ===============
                           DEBUGGING FLAGS
                           ===============

Debugging flags for the PubSub JavaScript Library can be set using the
kn_debug URL parameter, or by calling the kn_debug() JavaScript function
with a list of debugging flags:

  <a href="javascript:void kn_debug('posts')">kn_debug("posts")</a>

or:

<a target="_top"
href="../chat1/?kn_debug=posts">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat1/?kn_debug=posts</a>

When no debugging flags are given, debugging is disabled *AND ALL
JAVASCRIPT ERROR MESSAGES ARE SUPPRESSED!* To find the text of the
last suppressed JavaScript error, check the kn.lastError JavaScript
variable.

When debugging is enabled, the normally-hidden PubSub tunnel and
posting frames become visible in the bottom of the PubSub application
window. These contain the connections over which the web browser
receives and sends events, respectively, and are colored red and yellow
during normal operation (the tunnel frame may be missing in some
weblications.)

The debugging flags supported so far are:

all - turn on all debugging flags
events - pop up an annoying alert box every time an event is received
posts - display the contents of sent events in the posting frame
routes - pop up an annoying alert box every time a subscription is cancelled

More than one flag can be turned on at the same time:

<a target="_top"
href="../chat1/?kn_debug=posts,routes">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat1/?kn_debug=posts,routes</a>





                                =======
                                OPTIONS
                                =======

Sometimes the most correct solution to a problem is not the most
efficient, or is convenient in some way. To ignore correctness and
bypass some inefficient or inconvenient PubSub JavaScript Library
features, several options can be enabled using the kn_options URL parameter,
or by calling the kn_options() JavaScript function with a list of options:

<a href="javascript:void kn_options('single,noforward')">kn_options("single,noforward");</a>

or:

<a target="_top"
href="../chat2/?kn_debug=single,noforward">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_apps/chat2/?kn_debug=single,noforward</a>

The options supported so far are:

all - turn on all options
fastdoc - use document.open() for KNDocument
single - don't batch multiple requests
noforward - don't forward status events to the tunnel frame
escape - use JavaScript escape() instead of kn_escape()
unescape - use JavaScript unescape() instead of kn_unescape()
noswap - don't swap tunnel and post frames periodically

All of these options have compatibility problems, bad side-effects, or
actually break something. Use them at your own risk...





                           ===============
                           DEBUGGING TOOLS
                           ===============

A few miscellaneous debugging tools are provided by the PubSub
JavaScript Library. Briefly, they are: kn.publishForm, kn_escape,
kn_unescape, kn_htmlEscape, kn_stringFromCharCode,
kn_charCodesFromString, kn_resolvePath, kn_isReady, kn_inspectInWindow,
iw, kn_inspectAsHTML, and kn_inspectAsText. These are documented in the
PubSub JavaScript Library Reference:

<a target="_top"
href="../../kn_docs/javascript_reference.html">http://localhost/mod_pubsub/kn_docs/javascript_reference.html</a>

There is also one "javascript:" URI which may be useful for debugging
JavaScript applications:

javascript:/*_v0.2_*/_e=this['onError'];void(onError=function(p){var q=typeof _q=='undefined'?'=Math.PI':_q;if((q=prompt('Enter JavaScript to interpret. (Prefix with \'=\' for in-place evaluation.)\n'+p,q))!=null&amp;&amp;q!=''){_q=q;var s='onError(eval(unescape(\''+(_q.charAt(0)=='='?'_q=_q.charAt(0);_q+':'')+escape(_q)+'\')))';setTimeout(typeof Error=='undefined'?s:('try{'+s+'}catch(e){onError(typeof e.description==\'undefined\'?e:e.description)}'),1);}else onError=_e;})('')

This URI opens an interactive JavaScript interpreter in a pop-up
dialog. It is known colloquially as "jsi" or the PubSub JavaScript
Interpreter Bookmarklet; it's particularly useful when placed in the
Favorites or Bookmarks list for easy access.

Here are other bookmarklets you can try:
