    Edit the URL in the <frame src="..."> below to point to where
    your PubSub application lives, then save the HTA to a place
    in Windows from where you can double click on it to launch it.

    This HyperText Application (HTA) is an example of how to turn
    a PubSub-enabled application into a binary-executable-style,
    runnable Windows client application.

    HTAs are Windows applications that can access and use ActiveX
    components, COM objects, the Windows Scripting Host, and scripting
    languages.  The main window of an HTA is Internet Explorer, but
    the window that appears has no default menu, toolbar, or status bar.
    These are all configurable with parameters to the HTA.

    The main difference between HTML documents and HTAs is security.
    HTAs have the security constraints of Visual Basic and Visual C++
    applications: that is, in any COM-based language, HTAs have full
    read/write access to the hard drive and registry (unlike HTML
    documents, whose trust model sandboxes them to run only within
    a Web browser -- no filesystem or registry access).

    HTAs were created by Microsoft to give developers the power of
    programming Windows applications with the ease of scripting
    development.  With HTAs a developer can easily employ Internet
    protocols and formats like XML, HTTP(S), and FTP, and simple
    but visually attractive user interfaces with DHTML and CSS.

    By perusing this file, you'll see that HTAs are like really
    thin client applications that run on Windows that work with
    IE 5+.  Search for HTA tutorials on the Web to learn more.
