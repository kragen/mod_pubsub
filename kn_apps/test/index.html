 This web page is not pubsub-enabled for very good reasons!
 Don't make it pubsub-enabled, because it needs to test
 creation and deletion of leader pubsub weblications under
 different conditions, and if it were pubsub-enabled, it
 would become the "leader" and stay the leader, invalidating
 the tests.
