<h1>Blank Slate for In-Situ Editting</h1>

<p>This is a small demonstration of <a href="README">Derek Robinson's
In-Situ Editor</a>, pubsub-enabled.</p>

<p>To use this demo, you must use Internet Explorer 5 or above.</p>

<p><b>Click in this window to start; your cursor is invisible.</b></p>

<p>Then, type into this browser window while someone else is watching
this page on <i>their</i> browser, and they will see the changes you type.  And
vice versa.</p>

<!--

 FIXME: This part used to work in 2000, but for some reason we can't
 seem to get it working again in 2002.  Time to call Derek!  :)

<p>If you <b>cut-n-paste</b> (control-X and control-V) some HTML from a
web page, your markup is preserved.</p>

<p>Images and hyperlinks work too: for example, copy (control-C) this
hyperlinked Google image and paste (control-V) it somewhere else on the
page.  <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><img
src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif"></a></p>

-->

<p>Note that this demo is pretty brittle -- it is <i>not</i> reliable;
often you and your co-demonstrator will have to both reload your
browsers to get synchronized before you can do this in-situ editting
demo.</p>

<p>This demo is here to tickle the mind.  There's lots of collaboration
possibilities for this kind of in-browser, pubsub-enabled, WYSIWIG
editting.  We invite you to develop your own weblication using the
tricks.</p>
