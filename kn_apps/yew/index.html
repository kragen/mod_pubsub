<!--

 This weblication presents the splash screen and loads the yew app.
 The splash screen makes sure it has a working mod_pubsub connection
 before presenting a user interface dependent on mod_pubsub.

 It also gives us a place to display error messages encountered while
 attempting to connect.

var log = 'Loading the PubSub JavaScript Library...';

<!-- The PubSub JavaScript prologue, setting credentials -->
<script src="/kn?do_method=whoami"></script>

<!-- Cookie Auth Helper Library, overriding credentials if Anonymous -->
<script src="../kn_lib/cookie_auth.js"></script>

<!-- The PubSub JavaScript Library -->
<script src="../kn_lib/pubsub.js"></script>

<!-- Note that if I didn't care about user credentials, I could simply use

  <script src="/kn?do_method=lib"></script>

instead of the previous three <script> calls, which loads the PubSub
JavaScript Library with the prologue directly from the mod_pubsub instance. -->
