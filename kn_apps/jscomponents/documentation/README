	The KnowNow JavaScript Components include the following:

	•  KN HTML- A JavaScript library that allows you to easily KnowNow-enable your existing HTML pages by allowing HTML elements to subscribe to KnowNow topics and respond to KnowNow events. 
	•  KN Table- A JavaScript library that makes it easy to write a table of data to the page in a highly customized way. KN TABLE takes in an array of objects and writes each one as a row of the table. The columns are derived from properties of the objects used to construct the table. KN Table also provides sorting and pagination capabilities, as well as a number of template options to format the data the way you want to use it. 
	•  KN Form- A JavaScript utility library that allows HTML Forms to automatically publish and subscribe to KnowNow event topics. 
	•  KN FlashGraph- A Flash Movie that allows you to use JavaScript to dynamically control the position and size of a bar graph in realtime. 
	•  KN ActivePanels- a component that allows you to create dynamic content areas in a webpage that can be updated in realtime.
