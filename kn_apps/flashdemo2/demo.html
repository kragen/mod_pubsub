<input type="text" name="bob">
</form>

<ul>
<li> "Get" uses JavaScript to query flash and find out the value of its
textarea. 
<li> "Set" uses JavaScript to set the value of the flash app's textarea
(even though it's an editable text field and it kind of looks like html
it's actually flash). 
<li> Every 100 milliseonds, Flash is making a JavaScript call to set the
value of the HTML text input to match that of its own textarea.
</ul>

<li> Tested in IE 5.0 for PC
