   This sample demonstrates the PubSub JavaScript Event Collector
   object.  It should be fairly easy to replace the rendering stuff
   with references to FORM elements, if desired.

   To use event_collector.js, create an instance of PubSubEventCollection
   and pass it as the second argument to kn.subscribe. The object then
   maintains a "view" of the events in that topic.  It automatically
   removes deleted events and overwrites duplicates with any new
   header values.  The onEvent handler notifies your app of events,
   it is up to the application developer to decide how to interpret
   (and render) the results.

   There's also an "apply" method that basically takes a function and
   applies it to every event in the view. Very handy, not used
   efficiently in this demo (which redraws the entire list each time a
   new event is received).
