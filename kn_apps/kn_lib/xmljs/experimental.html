		<p class="body"><span class="hi"><b>New version 0.22.</b></span><b> Another bugfix release. Thanks to David Joham, Stu Coates and Mike Yukish for their help in fixing bugs, and to Chris Bayes for finding a bug I haven't yet fixed ;) - see the bugs section below.</b></p>
		<p class="body">Here is a simple non-validating XML parser written in JavaScript. This was written partly as an exploration of the issues involved in coding parsers for XML, and partly to see how useful such a parser would be for version three and four browsers.</p>
		<p class="body">The parser takes input from a string, so the way your XML is included in your page is up to you - as long as you can pull out a string containing the content, it can be parsed. There are several ways to do this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="body">Put your XML text in a <tt>&lt;TEXTAREA&gt;</tt>. The associated form could be hidden (in a hidden <tt>&lt;FRAME&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;IFRAME&gt;</tt>, or layer)</span>
			<li><span class="body">Generate your XML from script</span>
			<li><span class="body">Store/retrieve from a cookie - this might enable all sorts of extended metadata type applications. - <i>not tested</i></span>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">The result of the parsing is a set of nested objects, describing the document tree. There is a trivial Document Object Model to aid the interrogation of the objects.</p>
		<p class="body"><b>Version 0.2</b> of the parser now happily ignores processing instructions, DTDs and other prolog items. This is likely to remain the case in this particular design.</p>
		<p class="subtitle">implementation</p>
		<p class="body">The essential implementation objectives were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="body"><b>Speed - use as little recursion as possible</b>. Bitter experience of stack and memory limitations in version three and four JavaScript and JScript engines suggests that avoiding serious recursion is a good plan. There are some speed benefits to be gained here.</span>
			<li><span class="body"><b>Speed (2) - avoid character-by-character manipulation.</b> Again, this is a speed issue. <b>Version 0.2</b> implements a single pass parser (as opposed to the three-pass implementation of 0.1). This considerably simplifies the code. However, otherwise the main intent of the design remains intact - to try to consider the largest substrings possible, to reduce parse time,</span>
			<li><span class="body"><b>Compliance - implement as much of the 10-Feb-98 recommendation as is possible.</b> This thing has to be useful. The subset of the standard I have implemented (this isn't the final implementation) is enough to use XML in several embedded applications. A more faithful rendering of the standard is in the works. <b>Version 0.2</b> does not significantly change the compliance status - the current compromise is considered acceptable.</span>
			<li><span class="body"><b>Usefulness - provide DOM-like functionality.</b> In order to make the parser <i>slightly</i> useful, some DOM-like methods are provided. <b>Version 0.2</b> has significantly improved the object model - check out the code!</span>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">The code style used is minimally object-oriented, using some of the prototype model features that JavaScript provides. This may cause problems with some implementations of JavaScript/EcmaScript - notably, those not from Microsoft or Netscape. A purely procedural implementation is possible - shout if you want one.</p>
		<p class="body">The parser is provided as a single <tt>.js</tt> file - if some of the browsers in your target audience (notably IE3) don't support this, the code could be included in the document (or perhaps the parent frame of a frameset).</p>
		<p class="body">The code has now been widely tested on various browsers, with only some problems with some Mozilla milestone releases.</p>
		<p class="subtitle">bugs</p>
		<p><span class="hi"><b>Serious: </b></span><b>The browser may lock up if you have an attribute with a &gt; in the value. </b></p>
		<p class="subtitle">limitations</p>
		<p class="body">The obvious limitations of the code (notwithstanding those imposed by web browsers, such as probably incomplete Unicode support, and the various hacky approaches needed to access XML content) are in the lack of total compliance to the XML specification where it relates to non-validating parsers.</p>
		<p class="body">It is likely that this code is too lenient in some places through omission of well-formedness constraint checking, and too strict in other places as a result of the implementation technique used.</p>

		<p class="body"><b>Version 0.2<span class="hi"> </span>- this documentation has been removed, pending a possible rewrite - check out the code in the meantime :)</b></p>
