    This is dead-simple but useful script that subscribes an HTML tag
    to a topic, making anything inside that tag a template for each
    event that arrives.  In this way, you can easily make a "live"
    list of events, formatted any way you wish.

    To seed your PubSub Server with some purchase orders, submit to your
    Web browser's URL:

        http://mypubsubserver/kn/what/pos?do_method=notify&order_number=1&order_pcs=1000&order_item=Socks
        http://mypubsubserver/kn/what/pos?do_method=notify&order_number=2&order_pcs=1001&order_item=Shoes

    Now, if you want to build a live list of purchase orders,
    you can do something like this:

    <div class="event_list" kn_from="/what/pos" do_max_age="infinity" kn_deletions="true">
      <p>
        <b>Purchase Order #{{order_number}}</b><br>
        Item #: {{item_number}}<br>
        Quantity: {{item_quantity}}<br>
        Description: {{item_description}}<br>
      </p>
    </div>

    When you load this page in IE, the script will take the innards of
    the DIV tag and make it a template, replacing the {{braced}} text
    with the value of the corresponding PubSub header.  It will repeat
    this process for each event received, creating a formatted list.
