<!-- This weblication demonstrates how other pubsub weblications can be
     composed in a frameset to create more interesting composite apps.
     Here we're combining the "who" and "chat2" apps to make a chat room. -->

<!-- The PubSub JavaScript prologue, setting credentials -->
<script src="/kn?do_method=whoami"></script>

<!-- Cookie Auth Helper Library, overriding credentials if Anonymous -->
<script src="../kn_lib/cookie_auth.js"></script>

<!-- The PubSub JavaScript Library -->
<script src="../kn_lib/pubsub.js"></script>

<!-- Note that if I didn't care about user credentials, I could simply use

  <script src="/kn?do_method=lib"></script>

instead of the previous three <script> calls, which loads the PubSub
JavaScript Library with the prologue directly from the mod_pubsub instance. -->
