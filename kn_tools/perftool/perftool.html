<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>When not running in slave mode, perftool's normal operating procedure
is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> establish a number of tunnel connections to the PubSub Server
<li> wait for status-event activity to settle down
<li> set up a number of routes on the PubSub Server
<li> post events to the PubSub Server and receive them over the tunnels,
     printing a line of output for each event
<li> when the number of seconds specified with -r or --run-for runs out,
     or when interrupted by the user, exit.
</ol>

<h3>Command-line options</h3>

<p>There are three mandatory command-line parameters (when not running in
slave mode):</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>requests_per_sec</var></dt><dd>The number of input requests
to send per second.</dd>

<dt><var>servername</var></dt><dd>The host on which the PubSub Server
is running.</dd>

<dt><var>port</var></dt><dd>The port on which the PubSub Server is
listening.</dd>

</dl>

<p>There are also a number of optional command-line parameters:</p>

<dl compact="compact">

<dt>--master=<var>hostname</var>, -m
<var>hostname</var></dt><dd>Specifies that this perftool should act as a
master to the slave on <var>hostname</var>.  This option can be
specified several times to control several slaves.

<dt>--origin-topics=<var>n</var>, -o <var>n</var></dt><dd>Specifies
the number of origin topics to use; see Test configuration, below.
Default 1.

<dt>--journals=<var>m</var>, -j <var>m</var></dt><dd>Specifies the
number of journals to associate with each origin topic ---
<em>not</em> the total number of journals.  Default 1.</dd>

<dt>--tunnels=<var>t</var>, -t <var>t</var></dt><dd>Specifies the
number of tunnels to attach to each journal --- <em>not</em> the total
number of tunnels.  Default 1.</dd>

<dt>--topic=<var>/topicname</var>, -T <var>/topicname</var></dt>
<dd>Specifies the topic under which all this takes place, default
/what/apps/perftool.  The structure beneath this topic is as
follows:
<ul>
  <li><var>number</var> --- a number chosen to keep subsequent test 
  runs with the same --topic from colliding
  <ul>
    <li>origin -- origin topics live under here
    <ul>
      <li>1 -- the first origin topic</li>
      <li>2 -- the second origin topic</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>journals -- journal topics live under here
    <ul>
      <li>1
      <ul>
        <li>kn_journal --- the first journal topic</li>
      </ul>
      <li>2
      <ul>
        <li>kn_journal --- the second journal topic</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>--run-for=<var>nsec</var>, -r <var>nsec</var></dt>
<dd>Run the event-posting phase of the test for the specified number of
seconds, then exit; if not specified, runs until interrupted by the
user.</dd>
</dd>

<dt>--payloadsize=<var>nbytes</var>, -p <var>nbytes</var></dt>
<dd>Include the specified number of bytes in the kn_payload of each
event; if not specified, defaults to 0.</dd>

<dt>--simple-format, -f</dt>
<dd>By default, perftool uses the JavaScript tunnel format used by the
JavaScript microserver; this option makes it use the "simple" format,
which consists of RFC-822 messages, with header names and values
encoded in quoted-printable, preceded by a byte count.  Most of the
other microservers use this other format.
</dd>

<dt>--batchsize=<var>nevents</var>, -b <var>nevents</var></dt>
<dd>By default, perftool posts one event per input request; this option
makes it post batches of <var>nevents</var> events instead.</dd>

<dt>--slave, -s</dt><dd>Run in slave mode, obviating any other
options.  Not implemented.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Test configuration</h3>

<p>perftool deals with two kinds of topics: "origin topics" to which
events are posted and "journal topics" to which tunnels are attached.
Each origin topic has a certain number <var>n</var> of journal topics
associated with it.  A route is established from each origin topic to
each journal associated with it.</p>

<p>Each journal topic has some number <var>t</var> of tunnels attached
to it.</p>

<p>Each input event is posted to one of the origin topics; successive
input events are round-robined across the origin topics.  This means
that if more than one origin topic exists, each input event will find
its way to only some of the tunnels.</p>

<h3>Output format</h3>

<p>perftool's output consists of a header line, followed by lines
reporting on events received.  Each line consists of alternating field
names and values separated by spaces.  </p>

<p>The header line contains the following fields at present:</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><b>host:</b></dt><dd>the hostname where the server under test was 
running.</dd>
<dt><b>port:</b></dt><dd>the port number where the server under test was 
running.</dd>
<dt><b>tunnels-per-origin-topic:</b></dt><dd>the number of tunnels attached
to each origin topic; thus the number of copies to expect to receive of each
event.  This is the product of the number of journals per origin topic and the
number of tunnels per journal.</dd>
<dt><b>origin-topics:</b></dt><dd>the number of origin topics.</dd>
<dt><b>requests-per-sec:</b></dt><dd>the number of requests perftool was trying 
to post per second.</dd>
<dt><b>batchsize:</b></dt><dd>either 0, indicating that perftool was posting
individual events instead of batches, or an integer indicating the number
of events per request.</dd>
</dl>

<p>So a header line might look like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
host: circus port: 9041 tunnels-per-origin-topic: 1 origin-topics: 1 requests-per-sec: 1.000000 batchsize: 100
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The event lines contain the following fields at present:<p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><b>id:</b></dt><dd>the serial number of the event being received</dd>
<dt><b>received:</b></dt><dd>the fractional number of seconds since the 
          beginning of 1970 when the event was received</dd>
<dt><b>latency:</b></dt><dd>the fractional number of seconds since the 
          event was sent when it was received, i.e. the number of
          seconds transmission through the PubSub Server delayed it</dd>
<dt><b>conn:</b></dt><dd>the serial number of the connection on which
          the event was received</dd>
<dt><b>bytes:</b></dt><dd>the number of bytes received so far on that
          connection</dd>
</dl>

<p>So an output line might look like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
id: 45 received: 991593414.487212 latency: 0.015101 conn: 10 bytes: 8818
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Slave mode</h3>

<p><i>not yet implemented.</i></p>

<p>In order to handle large numbers of tunnels, perftool can be
distributed across several machines.  On all but one of the machines,
it should run in slave mode; it will listen on TCP port 19278 and do
nothing until it receives a connection from a master.</p>

<p>To the user, the master looks just like a normal non-distributed
perftool, except that it scales to larger numbers of connections and
higher data rates.  The argument semantics and output format are
exactly the same.</p>

<p>The slaves are used only for receiving events over tunnels.</p>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<p>The master/slave functionality is not implemented.</p>

<p>Except on Solaris, 
perftool is still implemented on a select() event loop, which makes
it slow on large numbers of connections.  It's still been used on up
to 20,000 connections, though.</p>

<p>perftool doesn't yet do much intelligent when connection attempts
fail, although it does report them and exit.</p>

<p>There are several places where unexpected errors will lead to
memory leaks.</p>

<p>All of its <small>HTTP</small> requests in the default
configuration use URLs beginning with "/kn//what", which is sort of
nasty.</p>

<p>It doesn't free things when it exits, which makes most memory-leak
checkers hard to use.</p>
