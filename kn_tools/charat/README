CharAt - JavaScript character set browser 

This test was written to explore Unicode/UCS support in JavaScript. 

This code generates an HTML table on-the-fly and displays a 'page' of
256 characters; a selected character is displayed in the corner, and
cells are hyperlinked to allow character selection.

The only portable way to dynamically update the table seems to be to
re-write the whole thing (ick!). Caching pieces of the document would
likely improve the update speed, as would generating more compact HTML. 

TODO: This still does not handle 'U+' notation for surrogate pairs. It
should also handle '0x' notation for UTF-8 sequences. Furthermore, all
three notations should be printed for each character. UTF-7 and/or
quoted-printable notation might be useful, but it seems like too much
complexity for such a useless and fluffy transformation... UTF-16 and
UTF-8 sequences should be printed space-separated; '0x' codes outside
the 8-bit range should be treated just like 'U+' codes; a decoded string
should only be used if it is completely decoded; '0x' codes should
always be displayed padded to two digits.

TODO: There should be an obvious way to select group/plane numbers (two
more tracks sounds really complicated, but a pair of up/down hex-entry
boxes might work well).  Once this is done, the left track can be
changed to only show four digits.

TODO: This still has no history, nor can it decode strings representing
more than one character, nor can it accumulate selected characters into
a string/textarea for copy'n'paste convenience (that is, act as a
'virtual keyboard'.)
