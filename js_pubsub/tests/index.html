<title>PubSub Test</title>

<!--

 This app is not PubSub for very good reasons! Do not PubSub-enable it.
 Specifically, it has to test creation and deletion of the leader
 JavaScript PubSub instance under different conditions, and if it were
 PubSub-enabled, it would become the leader and stay the leader.
