    0x7FF, // last 2-byte UTF-8 sequence
    0x800, // first three-byte UTF-8 sequence
    0xFFFD, // last three-byte UTF-8 sequence (and last BMP character)
    0x10000, // first four-byte UTF-8 sequence (and first Plane 1 character)
    0x10FFFD // last UTF-16 character (and last Plane 16 character)
    ];

// NOTE: characters past this point don't work yet.
//    0x110000, // first non-UTF-16 character
//    0x1FFFFD, // last four-byte UTF-8 sequence
//    0x200000, // first five-byte UTF-8 sequence
//    0x3FFFFFD, // last five-byte UTF-8 sequence
//    0x4000000, // first six-byte UTF-8 sequence
//    0x7FFFFFFD // last six-byte UTF-8 sequence (and last UCS character)
//
// The rest of UCS is unrepresentable in UTF-16. There's not much we
// can do at this point.
//
// A solution might be to map these characters into an extended UTF-16
// using the Private Use Area and/or the Extended Private Use Area,
// but that does have the disadvantage of being nonstandard. Perhaps a
// UTF-16-like mapping from UCS to UTF-16 could be adopted for
// characters beyond U+10FFFF:
//
//   I'd like to propose a character encoding (call it "UTF-21", since
//   it represents each UCS character using two 21-bit UTF-16 code
//   points) for encoding all of UCS in UTF-16, without changing the
//   meaning of any assigned UTF-16 codepoints outside the Extended
//   Private Use Area.
//
//   Given a (31-bit) UCS code point with this binary representation:
//
//       HHH Hhhh hhhh hhhh llll llll llll llll
//
//   represent it in a UTF-21 stream using two consecutive UTF-16 code
//   points chosen from the former Extended Private Use Area with
//   these binary representations:
//
//       0 1111 1HHH Hhhh hhhh hhhh (uses the second half of plane 16)
//       1 0000 llll llll llll llll (uses all of plane 17)
//
//   No UTF-16-style offset is applied to the value encoded in the
//   UTF-21 surrogate pair. UTF-21 surrogate pairs corresponding to
//   UCS code points in the range U+0000..U+F10FFFF are invalid, and
//   should be handled accordingly. The same considerations apply
//   here as apply to processing of overlong UTF-8 sequences.
//
//   The range U+F8000..U+10FFFF should be reserved in UCS, and the
//   resulting (smaller) Extended Private Use Area should cover
//   U+F0000..U+F7FFF. This is unlikely to affect existing
//   applications in any way, except when UTF-16 streams with Extended
//   Private Use Area characters are mistakenly processed as UTF-21.
//
//   UCS code points beyond U+F7FFF are expected to be rare enough
//   that the slight overhead for processing UTF-21 pairs won't
//   matter.
//
//   Unpaired halves could be ignored (that is, passed along
//   unmodified,) removed, or converted to the replacement character
//   U+FFFD. Basically, the same considerations apply here as apply to
//   UTF-16 processing.
//
//   This does use up 75% of the Extended Private Use Area, but it
//   also allows access to the much larger private half of
//   UCS. Another problem, potentially more severe, is that this is a
//   "nested" encoding, i.e. it requires two levels of UTF-16-style
//   surrogate pair decoding. This only matters, though, for
//   applications that need to manipulate the encoded UCS
//   characters. Other applications will pass the surrogates
//   unmodified, with no ill effects other than potentially incorrect
//   character counts (based on UTF-16 counts rather than UCS counts.)
//
//   The endianness and byte order mark considerations of UCS-2 and
//   UTF-16 apply equally to UTF-21. There may be a need for three
//   variants: UTF-21 (with U+FEFF byte order mark,) UTF-21BE
//   (big-endian, no byte order mark) and UTF-21LE (little-endian, no
//   byte order mark.)
//
// Anyhow, enough ranting...

// Generate a U+.... hexadecimal character code reference.

<h1>Post and receive an event</h1>

<p>This test seems to take longer than you might expect; although
it is only posting a single event (and therefore receiving three),
that event has lots of headers.</p>

<p>Various MSIE flavors take ten seconds or more to run this test;
we think it is because of some of the funky characters. MSIE 5.0
for Windows has been known to crash when this test is run inside a
frameset with another frame controlling the tunnel connection.</p>
