<h1>KN HTML</h1>

<hr />

<p>This example demonstrates the use of PubSub HTML to insert event property
values into HTML.</p>

<p>Enter text into the Payload text box and click the button to publish
the event.  The grey box contains a line of HTML with the PubSub tokens
{{kn_id}} and {{kn_payload}} inserted.</p>

<form action="#" name="zz" onsubmit="sendEvent(); return false;">
Payload: <input type="text" name="kn_payload">
<input type="submit" value="Publish Event">
</form>

<div kn_topic="/what/tests/kn_html/s/anonymous" style="background-color:#cccccc; width:400px; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">The payload of Event #{{kn_id}} is <strong>&quot;{{kn_payload}}&quot;</strong>.</div>
