<h1>PubSub JavaScript Samples and Components</h1>

<hr />

<p>Here are the sample implementations of some end-user applications and
components. All of these applications work in real time through browsers;
to implement them, you embed code in HTML pages.</p>

<ul>

<li>Sample Applications</li>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="buddylist/index.html">Buddy List</a> is a personal list
of one's "buddies." This list is used in conjunction with the Instant
Messaging application.</li>

<li>The <a href="chatlet/index.html">Chatlet</a> is an embedded Chatlet
window that any number of users can access to chat with each other.</li>

<li><a href="presence/index.html">Chat with Presence</a> is an embedded Chatlet
window that any number of users can access to chat with each other and watch
other users enter and leave the chatroom.</li>

<li>The <a href="im/index.html">Instant Messaging Client</a> makes it
possible for two people to share a private chat. They can use their
Buddy List to manage and contact their friends.</li>

<li><a href="screenpops/index.html">Screen Pops</a> can be used to
broadcast on-the-spot messages to one or more users.</li>

<li>The <a href="screenprompt/index.html">ScreenPrompts</a> make it
possible to send alerts to individual users.</li>

</ul>

<li>Demonstrations of Component Applications</li>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="activepanel/index.html">ActivePanel</a> sample is a
demonstration of the ActivePanel component, which can be used to create
embedded, "live" content areas in static Web pages without resorting to
frames. The ActivePanel uses PubSub technology to make it possible to
update these content areas in real time.</li> 

<li>The <a href="kn_html/index.html">PubSub HTML</a> sample demonstrates
the capability of sending data in real time to a location in a Web page
without having to use frames or the Refresh command.</li>

<li>The <a href="lwws/index.html">JavaScript Lightweight Web Service
Library</a> can be used to support and create other applications.</li>

</ul>

</ul>
