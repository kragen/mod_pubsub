When the user tabs out of the customer number field a PubSub event is
sent to the app server which looks up the customer record and returns
results via a PubSub event. <b>This happens without any reloading of
the page.</b>  Information is both sent and received via the PubSub
Form component.

</span>

<br /><br /><br />

<div id="theirpost" class="commentPop">
This form needs to be submitted to an external CGI that can
communicate with the database and return new information in a <b>new
page.</b> This style of interaction is both cumbersome and quite
foreign to users accustomed to the rich UI of desktop applications.
</div>

<div id="post" class="commentPop">
With the use of PubSub's <b>PubSub Form component</b>, this form has
been PubSub enabled simply by changing the action. With the user tabs
out of this field the customer number will be wrapped into a PubSub
event and sent to the server for processing.
</div>

<div id="get" class="commentPop">
Above we saw the <b>PubSub Form component</b> send information, and in
this example the same component is allowing a normal HTML form to
receive live information via PubSub.
