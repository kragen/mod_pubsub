After the user fills out the form and submits it to request.cgi (a
Perl, PHP, Python, JSP, ASP or Java application) a second page is
returned with the results. Every time the user requests information
from the server or needs to verify data, a new page will be loaded.

<div id="theirpost" class="commentPop">
This form needs to be submitted to an external CGI which can
communicate with the database and return new information in a <b>new
page.</b> This style of interaction is both cumbersome and quite
foreign to users accustomed to the rich UI of desktop applications.
</div>

<div id="post" class="commentPop">
With the use of the <b>PubSub Form component</b>, this form has been
PubSub enabled simply by changing the action. With the user tabs out
of this field the customer number will be wrapped into a PubSub
event and sent to the server for processing.
</div>

<div id="get" class="commentPop">
Above we saw the <b>PubSub Form component</b> send information, and in
this example the same component is allowing a normal HTML form to
receive live information via PubSub.
