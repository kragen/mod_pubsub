About This Distribution
-----------------------

This distribution contains a set of files that add publish and
subscribe to the Web for users of Perl, Python, PHP, JavaScript,
C, COM/ActiveX/.NET, Java, and Ruby.

This distribution includes the PubSub Server as a Perl Apache module
(using mod_perl), a reference standalone Python PubSub Server that
uses the same PubSub Protocol, a push_manager that helps with
additional connection pooling, and many sample apps.  (Perl and Python
work, push_manager needs a lot of work, and the apps are all in
varying states of usability and needing work.)

Please have peruse the file INSTALL for installation instructions
for the current Apache-based Perl PubSub Server and standalone Python
PubSub Server.

Plans are in the TODO file.

See also the index.html files in the mod_pubsub directory and the
mod_pubsub/kn_apps directory for an index of goodies included in
this distribution.  If you have questions not covered in these files,
please send inquiries to the mailing list

   mod-pubsub-developer@lists.sourceforge.net

Credits

A hearty thank-you goes out to all KnowNow employees and contractors
who wrote the code and documentation that has been included in this
distribution.

In the kn_apps directory, jscomponents is version 1.5.10 of KnowNow's
JavaScript Components libraries, released in January 2002.  We found
these on http://developer.knownow.com/ and since they use the KnowNow
license we're including them with this distribution.

kn_apps/soapstock uses an SOAP service from http://www.xmethods.com/ .
Thanks, xmethods!

We thank IRT and Keith Drakard (kif@irt.org) for the Connect Four and
Reversi games available in kn_apps/connect4 and kn_apps/reversi .
These programs are distributed under the terms of the WebGames License
at http://www.irt.org/games/license.txt .

In the python_pubsub directory, the following files are distributed
under the same license as Python: asyncore.py, cgi.py, cgitb.py,
inspect.py, pydoc.py . Refer to the file LICENSE in the Python source
distribution (http://www.python.org/) for details.  Note that we made
some minor modifications to these files to support pubsub.py .  It is
our goal to get pubsub.py working out-of-the-box with a Python release
without using the modified versions of these files.

Regarding that python_pubsub directory, we thank the many authors who
have contributed to the files included in that distribution, including
but not limited to Sam Rushing, Ka-Ping Yee, Guido van Rossum,
Michael McLay, Steve Majewski, Andreas Paepcke, Timothy O'Malley,
Greg Burd, Phil Harris, Andrew Athan, and Kragen Sitaker.

Also in the python_pubsub directory, we use an asynchronous HTTP/1.1
client library called asynchttp.py .  We thank Downright Software
<http://www.dougfort.com/> and Doug Fort <dougfort@downright.com> for
this library, which we found at http://asynchttp.sourceforge.net/ .

In the java_pubsub directory, we use HTTPClient from Ronald Tschalar
<http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/>.  The .jar is included
in the lib subdirectory.

Jef Poskanzer's excellent thttpd is used for the push_manager; these
parts are copyright <A9> 1995,1998,1999,2000 by Jef Poskanzer
<jef@acme.com>, distributed under a separate license.  See the file
LICENSE in the push_manager directory for full details.

Michael Houghton's nice 'xml for <SCRIPT>' JavaScript XML parser in
kn_apps/KN/xmljs is distributed under a separate license.  See the
file LICENSE in that directory for full details.

We also thank Dieter Bungers for the table widget we use in the
kn_apps/rsstable application.

Kudos to Scott Thomason for the RSSLite.pm we use in our RSS sensor
in the kn_sense/rss directory.

Many thanks go to Dave Winer who showed us many of the RSS feeds we
use in the kn_sense/rss directory.

If this distribution gets far, it is because we are standing on the
shoulders of the giants who came before us.  Thank you all.
