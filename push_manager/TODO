Add something about throttling to the hourly stats syslog.

Fetches with numeric IP addresses and no Host: header are screwing up the
vhost code?

Have directory indexing skip files that start with dot?  Except ..?
In libhttpd.c:
+               if (*(de->d_name) == '.' && *(de->d_name+1) != '.')
+                   continue;
                namlen = NAMLEN(de);

Add -p to mkdir commands?

Add comment on INDEX_NAMES that it should be simple filenames only.

Got some shouldn't-happen errors:
    throttle sending count was negative!
    write - Bad address
This are probably not new bugs, but rather existing bugs now being
noticed and repaired due to the centralization of hc initialization.

Weird thing - when thttpd got its nightly SIGUSR1 at midnight to exit
and let the wrapper restart, it did exit and a new thttpd started,
but the new thttpd sort of half-exited immediately.  The script
thought it had exited, and therefore tried to start up another
new thttpd.  But the process still existed and still has port 80
bound, so the other new thttpds couldn't run.  And the stalled thttpd
was not serving requests.  If this happens again, use gdb to find
out what the stalled process is doing.  Possibly stuck due to child
processes still running?

The error page generated for non-local referers should include the
original URL as an active link.

Does the initgroups() call work?  Or does it need to be moved to
before the chroot()?

Make open in mmc.c use O_NONBLOCK flag, to prevent DOS attack via
a named pipe?

Sites that clog with lots of TCP connections in CLOSING (not CLOSE_WAIT).
Related to throttling, and timers?

On A SIGUSR1, thttpd sometimes gives 'fdwatch - Bad file descriptor'
instead of the usual exit message.  Looks like we have to do any closes
in the main loop, and only set flags in the signal routines.  And once
we got a CPU-bound loop.

Switch all signal handling to use sigaction.

Make log entry at end of transfer instead of start, so it has the
correct number of bytes actually sent.  Likewise with adding to stats_bytes.

Document how symlinks interact with .htpasswd - authorization is checked
on the result of the symlink, and not the origin.

SIGHUP log re-opening doesn't work if you started as root.

Change redirect to put the Refresh command in the HTTP headers, instead of
a META tag.

Add TCP_NODELAY, but after CGIs get spawned.

Add stat cache?  1 minute expiry?

Ifdef the un-close-on-exec CGI thing for Linux only.

Add hash table to mmap cache.

Try using shutdown(2) in lingering close.

Check whether phf can still syslog from within chroot (probably not).

Can we remove the "if ( errno == EINTR )" check on the select()?

Add keep-alives, via a new state in thttpd.c.

The special world-permissions checking is probably bogus.  For one
thing, it doesn't handle restrictive permissions on parent directories
properly.  It should probably just go away.

redirect should interpret a path with a trailing / as /index.html

ssi should change $cwd to the source document's location.

Allow .throttle files in individual directories.

Log-digesting scripts.

Release process:
  - update version number in version.h README INSTALL and
    contrib/redhat-rpm/thttpd.spec
  - do an rcstreeinfo, and check in all files
  - do a tdiff and update the local installation
  - make tar
  - mv it to ~/acmeweb/software/thttpd
  - update version number in ~/acmeweb/software/thttpd/thttpd.html
