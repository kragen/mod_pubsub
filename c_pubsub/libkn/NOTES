To Do List
----------

Bugs:

- Need to handle HTTP redirects (and other status codes, for that matter).

Features:

- SSL certificate validation.

- Allow users to plug in their own random stream?
  (/dev/u?random is already checked...)

- Local callback URI.  (As opposed to persistent connection + journal
  topic callback URI.)

- Do we need a kn_Array?  Not really, but it has a high handiness
  factor.

- Tools should read/write POST field data format instead of (or in
  addition to) simple tunnel format.

- More tools: kn_ping

Performance:

- kn_Dictionary stores keys in a list and does a linear search for
  them, which, though quick to implement, is decidedly unclever.  This
  should be a hash table.

- Non-blocking API still blocks in several places.
