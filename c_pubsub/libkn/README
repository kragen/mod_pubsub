libkn is the C PubSub Client Library.

Known working platforms:
   Solaris 2.8 (sparc)
   Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (i686 linux-2.2.19pre17)

Unknown but once rumored to be functional platforms:
   Apple Darwin / Mac OS X
   FreeBSD 4.2
   NetBSD 1.5
   Red Hat Linux 6.1
   Solaris 2.7, 2.9

libkn should be easily portable to any POSIX operating system with the
GNU toolchain.

GNU make, gcc, and autoconf are required to build libkn.

To build libkn using Sun compiler on Solaris or Linux:
    ./setup
    ./configure
    make

Note that in Linux, you need to have installed g++.
You might also need to have installed libtool.

To put it in the right system directory in Linux, use "sudo make install",
which installs a basket of goodies in /usr/local/kn/libkn/ .

To build libkn using GNU compiler:
    ./setup 
    CC=gcc ./configure
    gmake

SSL support will be built if OpenSSL 0.9.6 can be found; by default 'configure'
will search /usr/lib and /usr/local/ssl/lib.  Use

	./configure --with-ssl=/path/to/ssl 

if OpenSSL can be found elsewhere.  Use

	./configure --with-ssl=no

to remove SSL support entirely.

To test libkn after building:

   gmake test TEST_URI=<kn_uri>

where <kn_uri> is the URI to a running PubSub Server (it will
default to http://localhost:8000/kn if unspecified).

To install libkn after building:

    gmake install DSTROOT=<destination>

where <destination> is '/' or some package root.

HTML-format documenation for the libkn C API is installed in
/usr/local/share/kn/docs.

libkn includes two commands, kn_publish and kn_subscribe, which allow
you to publish to and subscribe to topics on a PubSub Server on
the command line or within shell scripts.  If run with a '-h'
argument, they will print usage information.

libkn includes an Objective-C API (PubSub.framework) which wraps the
C API using the Foundation framework in Mac OS X.  This API is
experimental and is therefore unsupported.
