<h1>libkn API reference</h1>

<p>libkn is the PubSub client library.  It implements some basic data
types which contain information which is passed to and received from a
PubSub server, as well as routines to subscribe to, manipulate, and
publish that information.</p>

<p>The most critical data type in this library is the @kn_Event@ type,
which represents a PubSub event.  The typical PubSub application is
event driven: it subscribes to and responds to events received from
PubSub server(s), and it sends events back to the server to notify
others of activity on the client.</p>

<p>Other types, such as @kn_String@ and @kn_Dictionary@, are
convenient containers for information found in events or to be
inserted into events.</p>
