<h1>Example: subscribe to a topic</h1>

<p>The following example subscribes to the topic "/what/chat" on the
server at the URI "http://localhost/kn" and prints the payload of the
first event received.</p>

<blockquote>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;kn/kn.h&gt;

static void print_event (kn_EventRef anEvent, void* aUserData)
{
  kn_StringRef aPayload = kn_EventGetValue(anEvent, kn_EVENT_PAYLOAD_HEADER_NAME);

  /*
   * We don't use printf("%s", kn_StringGetBytes(aPayload)) because
   * data received from the server may embed nul characters, which
   * would be truncated by printf().
   */
  kn_StringWriteToStream(aPayload, stdout);
  fflush(stdout);
}

int main (int argc, char* const argv[])
{
  kn_ServerRef aServer = kn_ServerCreateWithURI(KNSTR("http://localhost/kn"));

  kn_RouteRef aRoute =
    kn_RouteCreateFromTopicToFunctionViaServer(KNSTR("/what/chat"),
                                               print_event,
                                               aServer, NULL,
                                               NULL, NULL,
                                               kn_TRUE);

  if (!aRoute) exit(1);

  kn_ServerProcessNextEvent(aServer);
  kn_RouteDelete(aRoute, NULL, NULL, kn_TRUE);

  kn_Release(aRoute );
  kn_Release(aServer);
