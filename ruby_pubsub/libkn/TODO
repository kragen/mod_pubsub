### BEFORE 1.0 WE MUST........................................

* Test/fix restart using checkpoint
* More exeception mgmt
* Manage redirects 30x (302) properly
* When re-establishing router connection, re-establish the routes or
  just hope they are there already
* kn_event_hash is valid and not kn_route_checkpoint in cluster
* Do HTTP-Auth properly
  'Authorization' => 'Basic ' + ["#{account}:#{password}"].pack('m').strip )
* kn_batch support
* connection-keep-alive ?
* Req/resp API?
* Eliminate FIXME issues
* Make an install.rb

### THEN WE CAN CONSIDER......................................

* Docs (write some)
* Threads, ugh - love em, but do I need them? it would be better if I didn't
* https support
* tests/ need to really "test" the libkn.rb
* Offline queues
* microrouter.rb?  Build a MicroRouter Spec compliant interface?
* Add in mod_pubsub/kn_apps/zack style delivery conf for proof of concept
