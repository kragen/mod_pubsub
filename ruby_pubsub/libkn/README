======================================================================

This package is not finished.  It is BETA quality code right now.
Some tests, features, docs, etc. are not yet complete.  Despite that
it is quite usable (and readable -- it's a good library to learn how
publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe work with a PubSub Server).

Feel free to make comments or to add code as you see fit.

If you have questions, feel free to ask the mod_pubsub developer list:
