To Do List for Python PubSub (February 14, 2003)
----------------------------

 0. Make a python pubsub client, client.py
 1. find out which of asyncore.py, cgi.py, cgitb.py, inspect.py, pydoc.py
    can be removed from cvs tree because they ship with the standard python
    distribution
 2. off host routes
 3. verbose vs. non-verbose code not covered
 4. Task.__repr__ never called
 5. scheduled tasks never have errors
 6. schedule never empty, so poll(None) never happens
 7. events never get compared to non-events
 8. illegal topic name characters never happen
 9. never create tunnels from non-journal topics
10. never posted to a dead tunnel (when not restoring from persistent store)
11. never pickled tunnels (when not saving to persistent store)
12. ev_encode's exception handler for string.join (needs to go away)
13. is_utf8 never gets exceptions raised in it, and its exception handler is stupid anyway
14. server.handle_error never gets called
15. simple-format responses never get sent except to tunnels
16. bad HTTP request lines never happen
17. we never parse HTTP response headers
18. we never get HTTP requests with continuation lines
19. we never get HTTP request lines without colons
20. we never get multiple HTTP headers with the same name and have to join them with commas
21. libform and lib2form don't get tested
22. do_method=route defaulting for GET requests not tested
23. 'welcome to pubsub.py' never gets run
24. 404 Not Found never gets sent
25. non-{GET,HEAD,POST} requests never get sent
26. send_response's '500 Internal Server Error' catch never gets run for some reason
27. self.sockname never gets interpolated into a string because Host: headers are always sent
28. Connection.repr never gets called because it has the wrong name
29. Connection.kncgi's else never gets called when getknroot() returns ''
30. FinishRouting, ReportRouteStatus, and HttpClient are unused
31. not serving any .gif or .jpg or default files in the test suites
32. most of read_event_pool and write_event_pool don't run
33. most of the option parsing doesn't run normally
34. add CGI support to pubsub.py
