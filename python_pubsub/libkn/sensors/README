We'll fill in a README at some later date.
For now, here's a typical way to start a sensor using bash.


# This starts just the nasdaq2 sensor
export PYTHONPATH=~/microservers/python:~/sensors/python
cd ~/sensors/python/financial
./sensor_nasdaq2.py


or


# This starts all of the sensors (sensor_*.py) in ~/sensors/python/aid
export PYTHONPATH=~/microservers/python:~/sensors/python
export SENSORPATH=~/sensors/python/aid
cd ~/sensors/python
./sensor.py
